# Proof of Security

Journal of my learning progress in blockchain programming and security. Don't forget to check also my ["before day 1 section!"](#Before-DAY-1)
Right now I'm working as a Test & Measurement Support Engineer, specialized in RF and high throughput gen/acquisition systems.
My goal: become a blockchain security engineer.
I try to spend 1h a day strict minimum working on this goal

#### DAY 173 23-june-2023 
> Hey ! Maybe I should update this sometimes :D
> I stopped updating it because, well, the motor is running now and I keep working everyday on this.
> Maybe I will now use this file to tell about my achievements

#### DAY 147 27-june-2023 
> Read some article on [Blockthreat intelligence week 24](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/p/blockthreat-week-20-2023)
> I decided to start a medium page where I will summarize every hack/vulnerability I read of. I should start to think about a template to follow while summaraizing.

#### DAY 147 28-june-2023
> Continued working on EIP-2535 and I think I understood it pretty well. It's really not that difficult in the end, and I was able to understand then the architecture of the project.

#### DAY 147 27-june-2023
> Starting Sherlock Symmetrical Contest (I'll go back to wenwin later)
> This project is based on EIP-2535 (Diamond Standard), which seems to be a pretty complicated architecture, but very useful.
> I'll have to spend some time to understand it, but it's worth it.

#### DAY 137 to 146 - 17-june-2023 to 26-june-2023
> AFK, big vacations. Still reading news coming when I have time ;)

#### DAY 136 16-june-2023
> 1h on Wenwin. I have finished the code. After reading the doc, I found out some things were understood wrongly. Still interesting to do this way though, because now when I read the doc, it's really easy for me to verify it in the code. I see the point of doing this, not sure if its the best method though, but it might depends on the codebase.

#### DAY 135 15-june-2023
> 3h on Wenwin, almost done.

#### DAY 134 14-june-2023
> 1h30 on Wenwin, trying to no overlook functions that I do not understand. Usually I would go quickly over files to get a grasp then go back if needed, but one of my weakness is the ability to fully understand complex functions. So I'll try to work on that.

#### DAY 133 13-june-2023
> Spent 1h on Wenwin. I decided to try another method to find the ones that best fits to me. This time I'm gonna start by reading the codebase, then after its done, read the doc.

#### DAY 132 12-june-2023
> Quick break to train again on auditing contests. This time with a friend, we will audit an already finished contest, and compare our results together, and with the actual report. The contest is [WenWin](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-03-wenwin)

#### DAY 131 11-june-2023
> Yesterday I had some issues to make my contract work with fees, had some errors, which forced me to read line by line the UniV2 code. Finally I found my error (which was stupid at the end, but sometiems its hard to just stop and think deeply for half a minute).

#### DAY 130 10-june-2023
> - Worked a lot on my ERC20, mostly testing it. I learned how to fork from the mainnet, i didn't think it would be so easy! (after reading for 1h...). Then I had some trouble to write the test, so I had to read carefully the UniV2 Router/Pair documentation, and finally, I was able to write some tests. Learned a lot on this session.

#### DAY 129 9-june-2023
> - Started to code the ERC20 with fees. To do so, I need to understand how UniswapV2 (or similar) works: how swap are done, when fees should be taken, and how to test it in a proper way. I'm not sure right now if I should deploy a mock UniV2 or fork the blockchain and test on it.

#### DAY 128 8-june-2023
> - Not easy to write tests! 
> - Read [Blockthreat intelligence week 21](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/p/blockthreat-week-20-2023). Great articles on CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) vulnerabilities!

#### DAY 127 7-june-2023
> Started to write the tests files. I know this will help me to write tests for my future audit contests

#### DAY 126 6-june-2023
> Went back to my project

#### DAY 121 to 125 1-june-2023 to 5-june-2023
> AFK

#### DAY 120 30-may-2023
> Started reading the [UNISWAP-V2 CONTRACT WALK-THROUGH](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/uniswap-v2-annotated-code/#introduction)

#### DAY 119 29-may-2023
> Started to write a threat model for the already written contracts. I will 100% use threat models now for my future audits
> Also continued to write the code. I've learned so much in the last 2 days about security. I understand now why PatrickCollins said during an interview that for him, being a dev can be very important as an auditor

#### DAY 118 28-may-2023
> After writing down the specs and a diagram (yesterday) I started writing the code.

#### DAY 117 27-may-2023
> Started my new project to prepare my coding skills for the ETH Global Paris Hackaton! I called it TogetherShitcoin which aim to solve the lack of liquidity simple user can face when they need to deploy a token with its associated liquidity pool.

#### DAY 116 26-may-2023
> Continued the Sherlock GMX contest. But I decided I will stop here for this one. This is a too big project, and I have the feeling that I'm not auditing solidity code, but rather a huge framework they developped. + they implements DeFi concepts I'm not familiar with. 


#### DAY 115 25-may-2023
> Read the [Blockthreat intelligence week 20](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/p/blockthreat-week-20-2023)
> Continued the Sherlock GMX contest

#### DAY 114 24-may-2023
> Continued the Sherlock GMX contest, i'm suffering

#### DAY 113 23-may-2023
> Continued the Sherlock GMX contest

#### DAY 112 22-may-2023
> Started the Sherlock GMX contest (12000 SLOC, ouch). Will first read the repo doc and site doc
> RACE-12 with a web3sec buddy


#### DAY 111 21-may-2023
> Same as day 110 : )
> Also did RACE-11 with a web3sec buddy (calculated score : 6.33)


#### DAY 110 20-may-2023
> Reading [Blockthreat intelligence week 19](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/p/blockthreat-week-19-2023)
> Studying [Dacian Precision Loss Errors article](https://dacian.me/precision-loss-errors#heading-division-before-multiplication)

#### DAY 109 19-may-2023
#### DAY 108 18-may-2023
#### DAY 107 17-may-2023
AFK

#### DAY 106 16-may-2023
> Reading [Blockthreat intelligence week 18](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/p/blockthreat-week-18-2023)

#### DAY 105 15-may-2023
> Wrote my QA Report. Even if I didn't find any H-M, I'm pretty happy with this one as I can see that I'm way more attentive to details. In fact, I was probably close to a Medium, but found it too late and wasn't able unroll it to the end. 
> This contest was a great step forward, I'm faster to read a big codebase, I'm able to understand it better, so now its time to dive back again to reading reports and articles to grow my internal database of vulnerabilities!

#### DAY 104 14-may-2023
> Dig into the Venus doc and codebase
> Also read Lending/Borrowing DeFi Attacks from [Dacian article](https://dacian.me/lending-borrowing-defi-attacks#heading-borrower-cant-be-liquidated)

#### DAY 103 13-may-2023
> Dig into the Venus doc and codebase

#### DAY 102 12-may-2023
> Dig into the Venus doc and codebase

#### DAY 101 11-may-2023
> Dig into the Venus doc and codebase

#### DAY 100 10-may-2023
> Started to dig into the Venus doc and codebase

#### DAY 98 8-may-2023
> I'm preparing to the Venus C4 Contest. It is a Compound fork, so I checked how to diff the 2 repos in a pretty way

#### DAY 97 7-may-2023
> Read Trails of Bits [audit reports](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/compound-2.pdf) of Compound II

#### DAY 96 6-may-2023
> Got a way better understanding of the protocol, I'm forcing myself to try to understand the maths and calculations.
> It was not easy to get my head around all these state variable names and link them to the whitepaper and docs

#### DAY 95 5-may-2023
> I cloned the [compound-protocol repo](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/tree/master) and will go through the main contracts : 
> - CToken.sol
> 	- CEther.sol
>	- CErc20.sol
> - Comptroller.sol
> And for sure I will go through the imported files and so on

#### DAY 94 4-may-2023
> Finally chosed to read Compound II documentation and code. Today I'm reading the whitepaper and the docs

#### DAY 93 3-may-2023
> - Reding Ethos C4 report. Loved the [M1 finding report](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-02-ethos/#m-01-low-data-feed-frequency-from-tellor-makes-your-protocol-vulnerable-to-flash-loan-attacks)

#### DAY 92 2-may-2023
> Wanted to change my readings and read this : [Searching On MEV-Share](https://writings.flashbots.net/searching-on-mev-share)
> In the end, I think it was worth it, as it important as an auditor to be aware of MEV ecosystem as this can be a vector of exploit sometimes

#### DAY 91 1-may-2023
#### DAY 90 30-apr-2023
> AFK 
> âŒ¨

#### DAY 89 29-apr-2023
> - Read Mute.io C4 Report

> Read Mute.io C4 Report

#### DAY 87 27-apr-2023
> Read GoGoPool C4 report

#### DAY 86 26-apr-2023
> Read Canto Subprotocol C4 Report

#### DAY 85 25-apr-2023
> Read Wenwin C4 report

#### DAY 84 24-apr-2023
> - Reading C4 Wenwin contest report. Did not participate to this contest. While studying a finding, I also try to read the associated sol file myself and understand it well. 
> - In the same time, I'm still filling my personnal vulnerability database. I found out that now I am able to generalize some finding, this will help me to get used to some patterns. Also I try to find the associated triggers that should lead me to detect a potential issue.
> - Trained in real condition on Secureum RACE-9.

#### DAY 83 23-apr-2023
> - My tool is now able to generate a report template from audit tags present in the code! Still haven't finished to polish it, once it's done I will publish it publicly on github.
> - I also spend again some time on EIP-712/2612 and permit functions. It's always great to go back to something I've already studied, as I can see things I didn't see before.
> - Trained in real condition on Secureum RACE-8.

#### DAY 82 22-apr-2023
> - Continued working on my tool.
> - Trained in real condition on Secureum RACE-7.

#### DAY 81 21-apr-2023
> - Continued working on my tool.
> - Trained in real condition on Secureum RACE-6.

#### DAY 80 20-apr-2023
> Started creating my own tool I call "AutoAuditReport" which will generate a report template from audit tags present in the code

#### DAY 79 19-apr-2023
> AFK 
> âŒ¨

#### DAY 78 19-apr-2023
> I understand [Picodes/4naly3er](https://github.com/Picodes/4naly3er) code, today I studied AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and tried to generate one, as it is one of the filter used to find vulnerabilities

#### DAY 77 18-apr-2023
>What a great day, [Block Threat Intelligence week 15](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/p/blockthreat-week-15-2023) is out

#### DAY 76 17-apr-2023
> Peeking an eye into [Picodes/4naly3er](https://github.com/Picodes/4naly3er) tool which is used at the start of each contest to generate the [automated findings](https://gist.github.com/Picodes/e9f1bb87ae832695694175abd8f9797f)
> I plan to add my own rules to it, because during last contests I spend a lot of time searching for my QA/Gas occurences using regex. Better to have a tool for that which automatically generate the report right ?

#### DAY 75 16-apr-2023
> Studying C4 NeoTokyo report. I participated to this contest, but couldn't find anything. 
> I was waiting SO much to get a report of a protocol I participated to.
> I've also analyzed the QA/Low report which got rewarded and from what I can see, I will need to : 1) use an automated tool like the picode one for the 'dumb' findings, 2) value original findings even in gas and low issues (2 is what I've done in the next ones)

#### DAY 74 15-apr-2023
#### DAY 73 14-apr-2023
> AFK âŒ¨

#### DAY 72 13-apr-2023
> Published my report. Finally got no medium... 
>I decided to make a break from C4 contests for a few weeks and start reading reports, PoC'ing findings myself, and filling my personnal vunlerability database. Let's go !

#### DAY 71 12-apr-2023
> - Starting writing my report. 
> I feel like I need to start reading a lot of reports, as I'm not able to find a lot of issues. I'm lacking a "mind database" of issues.
> I still found a potential medium though.
> - Read (a part of) the RubiconV1 report 

#### DAY 70 11-apr-2023
> Continued the RubiconV2 C4 Contest. 

#### DAY 69 10-apr-2023
> Spend some time studying Compound, as the Rubicon protocol v2 uses Compound cToken and Comptroller as a component.

#### DAY 68 09-apr-2023
> Continued the RubiconV2 C4 Contest. 

#### DAY 67 08-apr-2023
> Continued the RubiconV2 C4 Contest. Still focusing on gas/QA/Low issues.

#### DAY 65 07-apr-2023
> Started the RubiconV2 C4 Contest.

#### DAY 64 06-apr-2023

#### DAY 63 05-apr-2023
> - read the [Blockthreat intelligence](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/p/blockthreat-week-13-2023)
> - Spent 1h30 on the QuillCTF challenge [SlotPuzzle](https://quillctf.super.site/challenges/quillctf-challenges/slot-puzzle), still cannot solve it...  
> 

#### DAY 62 04-apr-2023
> - Spend 2h on the QuillCTF challenge [SlotPuzzle](https://quillctf.super.site/challenges/quillctf-challenges/slot-puzzle) 
> I was able to uncipher the procedure to calculate the slot using the [solidity doc](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/internals/layout_in_storage.html#mappings-and-dynamic-arrays), but still I haven't solved it. The dev behind is really evil

#### DAY 61 03-apr-2023
> - Read articles from [Week in Ethereum](https://weekinethereumnews.com/) section 'Security'

#### DAY 60 02-apr-2023
#### DAY 59 01-apr-2023
#### DAY 58 31-mar-2023
> AFK 
> âŒ¨

#### DAY 57 30-mar-2023
> I found my first medium, some gas and QA ! Really happy with that! Now I will have to wait ~1month to get the results :'(

#### DAY 56 29-mar-2023
> Continued the Assymetry C4 contest

#### DAY 55 28-mar-2023
> Continued the Assymetry C4 contest. This time I have decided I will focus on gas/QA/Low issues, and try to find as many as possible.
> I think this is a great way to train my focus and audit muscle. Also, I will have things to write down to train reporting.

#### DAY 54 27-mar-2023
> Read EIP-712 & EIP-2612 (the latter being an extension of EIP-712, but for ERC-20 tokens to add a permit functionnality)
> Started the Assymetry C4 contest

#### DAY 53 26-mar-2023
> - Read EVM Deep Dives: The Path to Shadowy Super Coder [Part 3](https://noxx.substack.com/p/evm-deep-dives-the-path-to-shadowy-3ea?s=r) and [Part 4](https://noxx.substack.com/p/evm-deep-dives-the-path-to-shadowy-5a5?s=r)

#### DAY 52 25-mar-2023
> - Spend some time on the QuillCTF challenge [SlotPuzzle](https://quillctf.super.site/challenges/quillctf-challenges/slot-puzzle) but did not manage to solve it for now

#### DAY 51 24-mar-2023
> Read this very interesting article about [Encrypted Mempools](https://joncharbonneau.substack.com/p/encrypted-mempools). Talks about privacy and protection against MEV.

#### DAY 50 23-mar-2023
> - Read the whole EIP-4337, I feel like this will break a lot of contract logic based on `address.code.length` to differentiate between contracts and EOA. Because after EIP-4337, there every address will have a logic behind it.
> - Started studying Chainlink protocol, for now just reading the doc, but I will go through the codebase soon. I've always been interested in oracles, and I think this is a good way to learn more about them.


#### DAY 49 22-mar-2023
> - Read the Biconomy report. I understand that before focusing on fiding medium issues, I should at least be able to find most of the gas and QA/Low issues pretty easily while going through a codebase. I'm not there yet, but I will work in this direction.
> I'm pretty sure this will lead to better understanding of the code, better methodology, and then give me more time and energy to focus on higher issues.
> - I also read the [Blockthreat intelligence](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/p/blockthreat-week-11-2023) as usual. A lot of interesting articles and hack walkthrough. 

#### DAY 48 21-mar-2023
> - Read the Looksrare report and started exploring some degen DeFi project (also reading their code published on etherscan)
> - Also read the EIP-1155 in detail. I remember few weeks ago being unable to read it properly, or any other EIP for that matter. I'm glad I'm getting better at it.

#### DAY 47 20-mar-2023
>- Last day of the Canto Identity C4 contest. Did not have so much time to spend on it, but submited a report with some gas and a low issue! I have the feeling that I'm more comfortable exploring a code base.

#### DAY 46 19-mar-2023
>- Continued the Canto Identity C4 contest

#### DAY 45 18-mar-2023
>- Started the Canto Identity C4 contest

#### DAY 44 17-mar-2023
>- Finished reading the report of the Frax contest, it was really interesting. I'm really impressed by the medium findings, which require for the researcher to get deep into the code maths (easy maths, but still it requires some time)

#### DAY 43 16-mar-2023
>- Studying the Frax contest (aug-2022). I've heard a lot about this stablecoin, that's a good way to learn more about it, and train my auditing skills at the same time!

#### DAY 42 15-mar-2023
>- Submited my first report for the Neo Tokyo C4 contest!
>I must admit this is not a great report, I did not had enough time to write it because of my planning today. But I'm happy to have submitted something, I've discovered the tools, the process a bit, and a barrier has been broken. For sure the next one will be better :)`
>- Started learning regex, I'm sure this is a very important tool to find some specific patterns, and thus better catch some vulnerabilities.

#### DAY 41 14-mar-2023
>- Continued exploring Neo Tokyo codebase. While Aragon was a way more complex project, it was easier to understand and follow.
>Project really need to be well documented and well organized, because this can make an audit way more time-efficient and effective.
>- Read Secureum Security Pitfalls & Best Practices 101/201 while exploring the codebase

#### DAY 40 13-mar-2023
>- Started (a bit late) the Neo Tokyo C4 Contest

#### DAY 38 11-mar-2023 & DAY 39 12-mar-2023
>- Days off ! 

#### DAY 37 10-mar-2023
>- Continued reading the [Blockthreat Intelligence newsletter](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/p/blockthreat-week-9-2023)
	>- [Smart Contract Obfuscation Techniques](https://degatchi.com/articles/smart-contract-obfuscation) was really interesting. The guy  built a more optimized custom function selector, with custom bytecode (and more)
	>- [The interview of Zhuo and Brian](https://medium.com/code4rena/demystifying-exploitable-bugs-in-smart-contracts-with-zhuo-and-brian-f8649d4c427f) who wrote this very important paper about the state of smart contract vulnerabilities was also very interesting (and their advices about auditing)

#### DAY 36 9-mar-2023
>- Read the [Blockthreat Intelligence newsletter](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/p/blockthreat-week-9-2023)
	>- Really liked this article about the inflation attack related to ERC-4626 vaults: https://mixbytes.io/blog/overview-of-the-inflation-attack
>- Did not have time to study the C4 Aragon contest, same for tomorrow :`( But I'm really eager to read the report when it will come out!

#### DAY 35 8-mar-2023
>- Spent some time on the C4 Aragon contest
This time I studied the Framework part, I though I got something but I was wrong. I'll try again tomorrow

#### DAY 34 7-mar-2023
>- Spent some time on the C4 Aragon contest
I've pretty well understood the DAO and Permission Manager, took some notes.
There's still the Framework part I need to study
The Aragon codebase is pretty big for a start, but I'm learning a lot even if not finding anything for now: 
>- learned coding patterns
>- learned a lot about DAOs functionalities
>- learned that staying focus and sharp is very important during discovery phase

#### DAY 33 6-mar-2023
>- Spent some time on the C4 Aragon contest
I've read the documentation and tried to understand the code

#### DAY 32 5-mar-2023
>- Started C4 Aragon contest 

#### DAY 31 4-mar-2023
>- Solved WETH-11 QuillCTF challenge
>- Started C4 Ethos contest, then noticed I was first planing to do Aragon with someone. 
I will do Aragon as there's only 2 days left to Ethos, and Aragon seems easier to understand

#### DAY 30 3-mar-2023
>- Suceeded in the #30daysweb3security challenge!
Thank you to the @Web3SecurityDAO for organizing this! 
>- I finally solved Damn Vuln DeFI #12 Climber!
Struggled so much bc of the execute/schedule ids+ manipulating the arrays, to finally get a pretty clean solution!
It would have probably took more time without this insane ressource : https://solodit.xyz/issues/682
By digging existing findings on similar topics, I was able to find the real vulnerability which certainly inspired this challenge
>- 2/ I also solved the QuillCTF : Donate!
https://quillctf.super.site/challenges/quillctf-challenges/donate
There's still the WETH11 available to solve
I like the idea of a leaderboard, remind me of CaptureTheEther but with a time limit 

#### DAY 29 2-mar-2023
>- Still not able to implement correctly Damn Vuln DeFi #12 correctly, but I'm half way
Continued reading Biconomy 2022-03 report

#### DAY 28 1-mar-2023
>- Bonked my head over Damn Vulnerable DeFi #12, I know I have the solution but issues to implement it.
When its like this, I'm better waiting tomorrow, it usually works better!

#### DAY 27 28-fev-2023
>- Started to get into the C4 Biconomy audit report, participating in the weekly audit study club from @Web3SecurityDAO
> While for past report I wasn't reading the project documentation, this time @ArtemkaWeb3 proposed to read the doc day1, good idea!

#### DAY 26 27-fev-2023
>- I'm pretty sure I found the solution to Damn Vulnerable DeFi #12 Climber!
>Using the audit tags helps a lot, but https://solodit.xyz/dashboard even moreðŸ¤Ÿ
>- Posted this thread about a vulnerability I think was fun enough to share it!
>https://twitter.com/InfectedCrypto/status/1630334513791287299
 
#### DAY 25 26-fev-2023
>- Got 4.5/8 at Secureum race 15 (got same grade for race 14). But I feel more comfortable now with the time limit. Also I could have gotten more, first question I forget there was multiple good answers... I think I can be in the top 32 next time :D
>- Started lurking into Damn Vuln Defi #12 : Climber. Taking this as opportunity to get deep into Upgradable OZ contracts

#### DAY 24 25-fev-2023
>- Worked on Secureum Race 10 to 14

>Will I become a Foundry devout when I'll finish it ?..

#### DAY 15 : 16-fev-2023

>- Started the Foundry Book. I know this is the tool to-go for auditing and testing smart contracts. Nearly every POCs are based on Foundry
>
>The Foundry Book : [https://book.getfoundry.sh](https://t.co/1ZylTfE9Au)
>
>I've been using hardhat for a long time, but reading the doc I see why Foundry is prefered. The integrated tools are really powerful : gas tracking, detailed callstack, fuzzing,  forking, evm debugger, ... That's INSANE
>
>- Started a Notion list of findings with tags and associated vulnerability
>
>Notion list of findings: This idea came from [@andyfeili](https://twitter.com/andyfeili) videos and interviews. I was feeling too "passive" while reading the audits. Filling up this database with findings, trying to sort them by type and type of vulnerability will certainly help a lot to learn them better!

#### DAY 14 : 15-fev-2023

>Today I studied the last hacks from Block Threat Intelligence 
& Started to read the PoolTogether C4 contest thanks to an initiative on the [@Web3SecurityDAO](https://twitter.com/Web3SecurityDAO)
>
>consisting in reading a report each week (which fits exactly with my todo on day8 !)

#### DAY 13 : 14-fev-2023

>I finally found the solution for #11 Backdoor challenge!!
What a relief, what a feeling.
Struggling during multiple sessions, thinking that you got the solution, but finally not...
But after each try, feeling that you're closer than before
>
>I really liked this challenge because I was forced to explore in details how the Gnosis Safe works, function after function, deeper and deeper. Damn Vulnerable Challenge are insanely well written, I can see the gradual progression. [@tinchoabbate](https://twitter.com/tinchoabbate) did an amazing job

>If you haven't already started doing CTFs, don't be afraid and jump into it. I like to take my time with CTFs and document myself a lot on related topics during the exercise, to get the most of it in term of knowledge.
>I'll probably go to code4rena once I'll finish them!

#### DAY 12 : 13-fev-2023

>Small day, just continued worked on the DVChallenge #11 Backdoor
I've found the solution, need to finish coding it
Compared to previous challenges, this one require us to explore a big codebase to find the solution. I really like the gradual step-up!
>
>Aaand, finally while in bedâ€¦ I found [a great article](https://t.co/tHK3yJd33D) on formal verification applied to solidity code
>
>Formal verification determine whether a given logical formula can be true or false based on a set of rules. We must not forget about these tools

#### DAY 11 : 12-fev-2023

>I continued exploring Gnosis src.
>Very interesting, they uses a "module" system, where a Safe is first a very simple contract-wallet w/ limited capabilities. But users can dynamically activate modules and execute their code : [https://github.com/safe-global/safe-modules](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-modules)
>
>I also learned about EIP712 (not 721) because it is used by Gnosis.
>This standard allows wallets to display data in signing prompts in a structured and readable format
>
>[https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712](https://t.co/oisSIVD0c5)

#### DAY 10 : 11-fev-2023

>Today I started the Backdoor #11 challenge [https://damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/challenges/backdoor/â€¦](https://t.co/4J3aFnG09n)
>
>Then I got lost in articles and docs about Gnosis Safe contracts
>
>Found out a lot of protocol make use of these, so it is important for an auditor to get a good >grasp on what it is, how it works, what vulnerabilities exists. For example, [here is a list of >countermeasure against MEV](https://t.co/d3RP91CI33) on Safes Tx 
>
>Found myself pretty lost for now in this challenge, simply because I still don't understand how >to interact with a safe in the first time. The Gnosis Safe documentation is way less helpful than >the Uniswap V2 one.
>I'll have to read the solidity code then!..

#### DAY 9 : 10-fev-2023

>I decided to continue reading articles and docs (links shared in next posts)
>
>- Went over all items of BlockThreat (a web3 sec newsletter) "Hacks" section
>
>[@blockthreat](https://twitter.com/blockthreat) share a weekly [newsletter](https://newsletter.>blockthreat.io/p/blockthreat-week-5-2023) about web3 security. A great way to keep yourself >informed of latest hacks, vuln, tools, or great articles.
>This week, oracle manipulation, reentrancy, business logic issue, ... 
>Will assuredly continue to read
>
>- Read the "awesome-oracle-manipulation" repo (0xcacti)
>
>Stumbled over this great repo sharing interesting readings about oracle manipulation :
>
>[https://github.com/0xcacti/awesome-oracle-manipulationâ€¦](https://t.co/1N27u94xhX)
>
>Went through most of them, but as always, you click a link, then from this link you click 10 >other links... Web3 security is really prone to rabitholing
>
>- Documented myself about oracles
>
>From these links, I really link Euler serie on oracles, they're easy to read. It emphasis on >Uniswap pools oracle (TWAP :Time-Weighted Average Prices) and its limits
>part 1: [https://eulerlabs.com/blog/prices-and-oraclesâ€¦](https://t.co/5KT8ebNgKu)
>
>part 2: [https://eulerlabs.com/blog/moving-average-filters](https://t.co/ACkNfUFwNB)
>
#### DAY 8 : 9-fev-2023

>I've never been so consistent in my learning, this challenge helped for sure !
>Today :
>
>- Read EVM Deep Dives Part 3 on Storage
>
>Before reading part 3, I went back to part 2 to be sure it was fully understood. Part 3 was >really cool, love how ingenious is the process to read packed variables, using bitwise and shift >operations : )
>
>- Read my first code4rena audit => Papr
>
>I finally read my first code4rena audit ! I tried to chose a pretty recent one : Papr (small >codebase). I still have to read the H findings, but I have read and understood the rest !
>Will try to implement this as a routine : read least 1 audit a week
>
>What I really liked too is that I did not only learn about security issues, but also how the >findings are rated, discussed, and demonstrated.

#### DAY 7 : 8-fev-2023

>Today I published [my writeup for the Challenge #7](https://coinsbench.com/>damn-vulnerable-defi-challenges-7-compromised-9ada74bc42fe) from Damn Vulnerable DeFi.
>I've already completed the #10, but I'm a bit late on my articles, but at the end this is a great >way to refresh my memory !

#### DAY 6 : 7-fev-2023

>Today :
>
>- I implemented the solution to #10 Free Rider from Damn Vulnerable DeFi, this is a step further from the previous challenges, loved it
>
>I think this challenge goes a step further as the solution require more research and reading outside of the challenge contracts themselves.
>Can't wait to discover #11.
>But first I need to catch up on my [CTF write-ups](https://medium.com/@infectedf)
>
>- Read through the EVM deep dives post from Noxx substack
>
>Noxx blogposts are incredibly well written, a go-to if you want to understand how solidity is compiled into opcodes, and how the EVM work through this.
>I don't know who created the EVM Playground but his work is a gift to us, learners!

#### DAY 5 : 6-fev-2023

>today i read the Uniswap V2 whitepaper + a great blogpost from [@samczsun](https://twitter.com/samczsun) on oracles price manipulation (iâ€™m sharing it at the end)
>
>Very well written, i prefered reading the whitepaper over the documentation, as all choices are explained, great reading from an auditor standpoint. 100% recommended to read it : [https://docs.uniswap.org/whitepaper.pdf](https://t.co/2q5FgcaMEh)
>
>The note [3] from this whitepaper leads to a great blogpost from samczsun on an oracle price manipulation, but i would like to share it another one from his blog which sumarize this topic + gives hints on how to mitigate these risks : gold!

#### DAY 4 : 5-fev-2023

>Went back to #10 free-rider from Damn Vulnerable DeFi this morning, eat, thought about it whil eating, took a train for a 3h travel, and found the solution!
>This challenge forced me to dig into UniV2 documentation, I feel way more confident about it now!

#### DAY 3 : 4-fev-2023

>Today I spent most of my time on challenge #10 from CTF Damn Vulnerable DeFi : [https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/)
>If I can give you an advice : don't give up on these challenges, you will learn a lot if you solve them by yourself. I'm giving you an alpha from [@pashovkrum](https://twitter.com/pashovkrum) if you find something hard, most of your competitor will find it hard too first time. Make the diff and don't giveup
>My own advice : don't try to rush everything, do it on your own pace. My style is to follow my curiosity. This can slow you down, but on the long run you will get a lot more depth

#### DAY 2 : 3-fev-2023

>Finished my Solidity 201 Quizz writeup !
Will probably start next quizz tomorrow.
This is a great way to practice and learn when you don't have that much time on your schedule !

#### DAY 1 : 2-fev-2023

>A challenge started on Discord Web3SecurityDAO, its called #30daysweb3security 
>I was already trying to work each and every day on web3 security, but doing it publicly with a group can be very encouraging!
>Let's try to run this challenge !
>Today I'm continuing writeups of [@Secureum](https://twitter.com/Secureum) quizzes, a great way to test my knowledge and then fixing it in my mind by doing research and writing them !

[InfectedIsm/some-quizz](https://t.co/ivP1CjuDV8)

#### Before DAY 1
>- Started with CryptoZombies
>- Read Ethereum White Paper
>- Read Ethereum Workbook 
>- Read Solidity Doc
>- Then BuildSpace web3 course
>- Solved Lotteries and Math from Capture the Ether. I learned a LOT with these challenges (Remix, >Etherscan, and of course Solidity), I highly recommend them
>- Eats the Blocks 6-figures training (not the best one, wouldn't recommend it its based on 0.4.2)
>- Learned a bit of web deb with Angular and Typescript
>- Learned Truffle and Ganache, but didn't like it at all
>- Learned Hardhat, was way better
>- Wrote writeup to multiple quizzes (Rareskill, Secureum)
