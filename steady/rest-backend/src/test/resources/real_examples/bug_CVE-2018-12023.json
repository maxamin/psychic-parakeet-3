"description": "An issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind prior to 2.7.9.4, 2.8.11.2, and 2.9.6. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property), the service has the Oracle JDBC jar in the classpath, and an attacker can provide an LDAP service to access, it is possible to make the service execute a malicious payload.",
"descriptionAlt": "Block polymorphic deserialization of types from Oracle JDBC driver. Description: There is a potential remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, if user is 1. handling untrusted content (where attacker can craft JSON) 2. using \"Default Typing\" feature (or equivalent; polymorphic value with base type of java.lang.Object  3. has oracle JDBC driver jar in classpath  4. allows connections from service to untrusted hosts (where attacker can run an LDAP service). (note: steps 1 and 2 are common steps as explained in https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062). To solve the issue, 2 types from JDBC driver are blacklisted to avoid their use as \"serialization gadgets\".",
