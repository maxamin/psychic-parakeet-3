/**
 * Json Views used to filter the entity fields to be serialized based on the API used.
 *
 * Default: Used across all controllers for APIs that requires a minimal set of information for each entity (as it will exclude all fields with a different view annotated).
 * BugDetails: Used in the BugController for API that includes details about the bug(i.e., constructChanges, and constructChanges counter)
 * BugAffLibs: Used in the BugController for API that includes details about the affectedLibrary (i.e., libraryId and affected construct changes)
 * LibDetails: Used in LibraryController for API that includes details about the Library (including its counters extending the CountDetails view)
 * CountDetails: Used in Application and Library for counter fields
 * DepDetails: Used in ApplicationController for API that includes dependencies to include reachableConstructIds and touchPoints on top of libDetails such as the properties
 * AppDepDetails: Used in the LIbraryController to return the dependency of applications based on a given digest (otherwise the dependency is never serialized when returning applications)
 * GoalDetails: Used in ApplicationController for the goal details
 * VulnDepDetails: Used in ApplicationController to get details for vulnerable dependencies (i.e., constructList)
 * Never: Used in Entity fields that will never be serialized (thus never used in the controllers)
 * LibraryIdDetails: Used in the LibraryIdController to include infomation about affected LibIds when getting all versions of a Maven artifact
