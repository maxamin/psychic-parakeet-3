Vulnerabilities in Steady are represented at code level. It is possible to add new vulnerabilities to the database using the 'patch analyzer' module of the vulas project. To add a new vulnerability of a given library, the following fields need to be provided as input:

* bug (-b) <arg> : vulnerability identifier
* repo (-r) <arg> : URL of the VCS repository hosting the library project
* revision (-e) <arg> :  One or multiple revisions (multiple ones must be comma-separated w/o blanks). In the case of Git repositories, the revision can be optionally concatenated with ':' with the branch information.
* description (-descr) <arg> : Textual vulnerability description (optional, it must be provided for vulnerabilities not available from the NVD)
* links (-links) <arg> : Comma-separated list of links to comprehensive vulnerability information (optional, it must be provided for vulnerabilities not available from the NVD)
* skip-if-existing (-sie) : Skips the analysis of a vulnerability if it already exists in the backend
* upload (-u) : Upload construct changes

Additionally the vulas backend service URL must be configured. 

As examples, the commands below show the usage of the patch analyzer to analyze vulnerabilities
* CVE-2017-7525 (Jackson Databind)
* CVE-2018-5382 (BouncyCastle)
* CVE-2018-11039 (Spring)
* CVE-2014-0050 (Apache Commons FileUpload)
* COLLECTIONS-580 (Apache Commons Collections)

and upload the resulting vulnerable constructs to a vulas backend running at http://localhost:8033/backend.

Description: Spring Framework (versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.7, versions 4.3.x prior to 4.3.18, and older unsupported versions) allow web applications to change the HTTP request method to any HTTP method (including TRACE) using the HiddenHttpMethodFilter in Spring MVC. If an application has a pre-existing XSS vulnerability, a malicious user (or attacker) can use this filter to escalate to an XST (Cross Site Tracing) attack. Affected Pivotal Products and Versions: Spring Framework 5.0 to 5.0.6, Spring Framework 4.3 to 4.3.17, Older unsupported versions are also affected. Mitigation: Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation: \n 5.0.x users should upgrade to 5.0.7. \n- 4.3.x users should upgrade to 4.3.18. - Older versions should upgrade to a supported branch. \nThere are no other mitigation steps necessary. This attack applies to applications that: \n1/ Use the HiddenHttpMethodFilter (it is enabled by default in Spring Boot). \n2/ Allow HTTP TRACE requests to be handled by the application server. \nThis attack is not exploitable directly because an attacker would have to make a cross-domain request via HTTP POST, which is forbidden by the Same Origin Policy. This is why a pre-existing XSS (Cross Site Scripting) vulnerability in the web application itself is necessary to enable an escalation to XST." -u

To run such commands in your own environment, you may need to adapt:
* the path to the patch analyzer artifact and the artifact version, '-jar ./patch-analyzer/target/patch-analyzer-3.0.10-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar'
* the url of the vulas backend, `-Dvulas.shared.backend.serviceUrl=http://localhost:8033/backend`
* the proxy settings; the proxy is not configured in the example but you can do so using the following configurations:
```
-Dhttp.proxyHost=
-Dhttp.proxyPort=
-Dhttps.proxyHost=
-Dhttps.proxyPort= 
-Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=
``` 


## Vulnerabilities of proprietary libraries

Steady can also handle undisclosed vulnerabilities and proprietary components. This allows to make company-internal users of proprietary libraries aware and update to non-vulnerable versions.

Send an email to the administrators of your instance of Eclipse Steady in order to request the addition of such vulnerabilities to the database, and include the following info:
- Brief description of the vulnerability (max 2-3 lines) using the NVD vulnerability description style and phrasing (e.g. including the type of vulnerability, the affected software component).
- URL of the code repository of the affected component.
- Commit(s) used to the fix the vulnerability in the component.
- Links with additional information about the vulnerability (if available).

Once this information is received by the Steady team, an ID will be attributed to the vulnerability and a new entry will be created in the Steady Database. All company-internal users will be notified in the same way as for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in open-source components.
