# Push Docker images on a registry

## Pre-requisites

- git
- bash
- docker
- docker-compose

## Generate @@PROJECT_NAME@@ images

In order to generate the Docker images to upload to a local registry, you should generate @@PROJECT_NAME@@'s Java archives. This can be done following [Build JAVA archives/Docker images](../build/) tutorial. To briefly summarize you should build and run an image which will populate your local directories with the @@PROJECT_NAME@@ JARs and WARs. In the end of this preliminary step you should have your images locally, this can be tested with the command `docker images | grep steady`.

```sh
# sample output for `docker images` command

## Push the images to a registry

A script was created to push the images to a local Docker registry running inside your organization. [This script](https://github.com/eclipse/steady/blob/master/docker/push-images.sh) simply tags the images and pushes them towards the registry.

To use the script you will need:

- a registry in your organization (e.g., [goharbor/harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor))
- a username
- @@PROJECT_NAME@@ used version

Invoke the script with the following positional arguments.

```sh
docker login [registry]
bash push-images.sh -r [registry] -p [project] -v [steady-version]
```

## Pulling the images from a repository

You can use Docker to pull your images from a registry.

```sh
docker pull [registry]/[project]/steady-rest-backend:[steady-version]
```
