# ANTLR grammar

@@PROJECT_NAME@@ uses ANTLR to parse Java and Python source code.

Grammars are downloaded from https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4 and put into directory `src/main/antlr4` (in subdirectories matching the target Java package namespace of the generated parsers, e.g., `org/eclipse/steady/java/antlr` for Java).

The actual Java classes are generated by the ANTLR plugin `org.antlr:antlr4-maven-plugin`.

## Python

Grammars https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/... and https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/python3 are put into the modules `lang-python`, folder `src/main/antlr4/org/eclipse/steady/python/antlr/python3` and `python355`.

The default parser has been generated from the Python 3.3.5 grammar, including for Python 2 source code.

Which parser is taken at runtime depends on the presence of language features specific to Python 2 (e.g., `raw_input`) and Python 3.5 (e.g., `async`), see Java class `PythonFileAnalyzer` in module `lang-python`.
