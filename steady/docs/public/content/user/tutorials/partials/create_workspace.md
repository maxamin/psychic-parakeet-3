!!! info "Workspace creation"
    If you do not have a workspace yet, you can easily create one by going on the application frontend and clicking on
    the third button in the lower left corner:

    <center>![Setup workspace button](../../tutorials/img/frontend_toolbar_create_workspace.png)</center>

    For a detailed description of workspaces and of the inputs you have to provide in the form that is displayed when you click that button,
    please see [this section of the manual](../../manuals/setup/#workspace).
