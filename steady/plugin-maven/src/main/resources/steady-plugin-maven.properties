# Options to include and exclude Maven artifacts (modules) during the processing of an aggregator project.
# If includes is provided, the other parameters are ignored. In other words, excludes and ignorePoms will
# only be evaluated if includes is empty.
#
# Important: Those options are ignored in case of the report goal, thus, report will be run on all modules.
# In particular, running report on a module with packaging POM will create an aggregated report for all its
# submodules.
#
# One has to provide the artifactId (not the module name), and multiple values for includes and excludes must
# be separated by comma.
#
# Defaults:
#   includes = -
#   excludes = -
#   ignorePoms = false
vulas.maven.includes =
vulas.maven.excludes =
vulas.maven.ignorePoms = false

# Name of the property into which the -javagent option as well as all the configuration
# settings will be injected.
#
# Defaults: argLine (used by maven-surefire-plugin)
#vulas.maven.agent.propertyName
