# Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting

The code below is vulnureable to Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting

```javascript
// This code is for an API endpoint that allows users to access a large amount of data

// Check if the user is authenticated

if (!req.isAuthenticated()) {
  res.status(401).json({
    error: "Unauthorized"
  });
  return;
}

// Read the user's input from the request

let limit = req.query.limit || 100;
let offset = req.query.offset || 0;

// Get the data from the database

Data.find({})
  .limit(limit)
  .skip(offset)
  .exec((err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      res.status(500).json({
        error: err
      });
      return;
    }

    // Return the data
    res.json({
      data: data
    });
  });

```

# Why it's vulnerable?
The code is allowing users to access a large amount of data from the database by using the limit and offset parameters in the request. However, the code is not limiting the amount of data that can be accessed or the rate at which it can be accessed, which means that a user could potentially send many requests in a short amount of time and overload the server. 

# Impact?
This is an example of a lack of resources and rate limiting, because the code is not properly managing the resources required to handle the requests and is not limiting the rate at which requests can be made.

# How to fix?
To avoid this type of vulnerability, it is important to implement resource management and rate limiting mechanisms in your code. This can help to ensure that the server has enough resources to handle the requests it receives and to prevent any single user or group of users from overloading the server by making too many requests.
