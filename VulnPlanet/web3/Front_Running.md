# Front-Running

Smart contract below is vulnureable to Front Running (Race condition)

```solidity
contract Exchange {
  mapping (address => uint) public balances;

  function buyToken(uint _amount) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);
    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    balances[this] += _amount;
  }

  function sellToken(uint _amount) public {
    require(balances[this] >= _amount);
    balances[this] -= _amount;
    balances[msg.sender] += _amount;
  }
}
```

# Why it's vulnerable?
This contract is a simple token exchange, where users can buy and sell tokens using their Ethereum balance. However, it is vulnerable to a front running (race condition) vulnerability because the ```buyToken()``` and ```sellToken()``` functions do not check if the caller's balance has changed between the time the transaction is sent and the time it is executed.

# Impact?
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could first call the ```buyToken()``` function, transferring some funds to the contract. They could then quickly call the ```sellToken()``` function, transferring the funds back to themselves before the ```buyToken()``` transaction is executed. This would allow the attacker to profit from the price difference between the two transactions.

# How to fix?
To prevent this vulnerability, the contract should be updated to check the caller's balance before executing a transaction. Here is an updated version of the contract that checks the caller's balance before executing the ```buyToken()``` and ```sellToken()``` functions:

```solidity
contract Exchange {
  mapping (address => uint) public balances;

  function buyToken(uint _amount) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);
    require(balances[msg.sender] == this.balanceOf(msg.sender));
    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    balances[this] += _amount;
  }

  function sellToken(uint _amount) public {
    require(balances[this] >= _amount);
    require(balances[msg.sender] == this.balanceOf(msg.sender));
    balances[this] -= _amount;
    balances[msg.sender] += _amount;
  }
}
```

In this updated version of the contract, the ```buyToken()``` and ```sellToken()``` functions check the caller's balance using the ```this.balanceOf()``` function before executing the transaction. This ensures that the transaction is executed only if the caller's balance has not changed, which prevents the front running (race condition) vulnerability.
