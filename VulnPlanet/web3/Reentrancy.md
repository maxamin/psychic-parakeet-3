# Reentrancy

Smart contract below is vulnureable to Reentrancy (Race to empty)

```solidity
contract FundTransfer {
  address public owner;
  mapping (address => uint) public balances;

  function FundTransfer() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function transfer(address _to, uint _amount) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);
    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    balances[_to] += _amount;
  }

  function withdraw() public {
    uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
    balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    msg.sender.transfer(amount);
  }
}
```

# Why it's vulnerable?
This contract allows users to transfer funds to each other, and also allows them to withdraw their funds. However, the ```withdraw()``` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

# Impact?
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability as follows:

1. The attacker creates a malicious contract that calls the ```transfer()``` function of the FundTransfer contract, transferring funds from the attacker's account to the malicious contract's account.
2. The attacker then calls the ```withdraw()``` function on the FundTransfer contract, which will transfer all of the attacker's funds to the attacker's external address.
3. Since the ```withdraw()``` function does not check if the caller is a contract or an external address, the malicious contract is able to receive the funds that were just transferred to it.
4. The malicious contract then calls the ```withdraw()``` function again, repeating the process and allowing the attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds from the ```FundTransfer``` contract.

# How to fix?
To prevent this vulnerability, the ```withdraw()``` function should be updated to check if the caller is a contract, and if so, it should prevent the contract from calling the ```withdraw()``` function again. This can be done using the ```require()``` function, as shown in the following example:

```solidity
function withdraw() public {
  require(!msg.sender.isContract());
  uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
  balances[msg.sender] = 0;
  msg.sender.transfer(amount);
}
```

In this updated version of the contract, the ```withdraw()``` function will only allow external addresses to withdraw funds. If a contract attempts to call the ```withdraw()``` function, the ```require()``` statement will cause the transaction to revert and the contract will not be able to withdraw funds.
