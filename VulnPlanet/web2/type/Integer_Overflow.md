# Why it's vulnerable?

1. Integer overflow: In the line int ```size1 = img.width + img.height;```, if the ```sum``` of ```img.width``` and ```img.height``` is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in an int variable, it will cause an integer overflow, which could lead to undefined behavior.

2. No data buffer size/malloc success check: In the line ```memcpy(buff1,img.data,sizeof(img.data));```, there is no check to ensure that the ```malloc()``` call succeeded in allocating memory for buff1, nor is there a check to ensure that the size of ```img.data``` is not larger than the size of ```buff1```. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow.

3. Double free: In the lines ```if (size1/2==0){ free(buff1); }```, if ```size1``` is an even number, ```buff1``` will be freed, but it is also freed later on in the code. This could potentially lead to a double free error, where memory is freed twice, leading to undefined behavior.

4. Use after free: In the lines ```if(size1 == 123456){ buff1[0]='a'; }```, if ```size1``` is equal to ```123456```, ```buff1``` will be accessed after it has been freed, which could potentially lead to a use after free error, where memory that has been freed is accessed or modified.

5. Integer underflow: In the line ```int size2 = img.width - img.height+100;```, if the difference of ```img.width``` and ```img.height``` is smaller than 100, it will cause an integer underflow, which could lead to undefined behavior.

6. Out of bound read (stack): In the line ```char OOBR_stack = buff3[size3+100];```, if ```size3``` is larger than the size of ```buff3```, this will cause an out of bounds read from the stack, which could potentially lead to a crash or other undefined behavior.

7. Out of bound write (stack): In the line ```buff3[size3+100]='c';```, if ```size3``` is larger than the size of ```buff3```, this will cause an out of bounds write to the stack, which could potentially lead to a crash or other undefined behavior.

8. Out of bound read (heap): In the line ```char OOBR_heap = buff4[100];```, if ```buff4``` is not large enough to hold an element at index 100, this will cause an out of bounds read from the heap, which could potentially lead to a crash or other undefined behavior.

9. Out of bound write (heap): In the line ```buff4[100]='c';```, if ```buff4``` is not large enough to hold an element at index 100, this will cause an out of bounds write to the heap, which could potentially lead to a crash or other undefined behavior.

10. Memory leak: In the lines ```if(size3>10){ buff4=0; }```, if ```size3``` is greater than 10, ```buff4``` will be set to 0, but it is not freed. This could potentially lead to a memory leak, where memory is allocated but never freed.
