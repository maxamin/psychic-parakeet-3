# Denial Of Service

The code below is vulnureable to Denial Of Service


```python
def handle_request(request):
  # Do some processing on the request

  # Check if the user has exceeded their maximum allowed requests
  if user_has_exceeded_max_requests(request.user):
    # Return an error message
    return "Error: You have exceeded your maximum number of requests"

  # Return the processed request
  return request
```


# Why it's vulnerable?
In this example, the ```handle_request``` function is responsible for processing incoming requests. It checks to see if the user has exceeded their maximum allowed requests, and if they have, it returns an error message. However, this code is vulnerable to a DoS attack because it doesn't put a limit on the number of requests that a user can make in a given time period. 

# Impact?
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by making a large number of requests in a short amount of time, causing the system to become overwhelmed and unable to process legitimate requests.

# How to fix?
To prevent this type of attack, the code should include a rate-limiting mechanism that allows a maximum number of requests per unit of time. This can help to ensure that the system remains available to legitimate users even in the face of a DoS attack.
