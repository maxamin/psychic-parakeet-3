# Code Execution

The code below is vulnureable to Code Execution

```ruby
module Jobs

  class ConfirmSnsSubscription < ::Jobs::Base
    sidekiq_options retry: false

    def execute(args)
      return unless raw = args[:raw].presence
      return unless json = args[:json].presence
      return unless subscribe_url = json["SubscribeURL"].presence

      require "aws-sdk-sns"
      return unless Aws::SNS::MessageVerifier.new.authentic?(raw)

      # confirm subscription by visiting the URL
      open(subscribe_url)
    end

  end

end
```

# Why it's vulnerable?
This code is vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack. The ```open()``` method is used to visit a URL specified in the ```subscribe_url``` variable, which is provided in the json parameter. If the json parameter is not properly validated or sanitized, it may be possible for an attacker to supply a malicious URL that could be used to execute arbitrary code on the server.

# Impact?
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could craft a special URL that contains malicious code, and then provide this URL as the subscribe_url in the json parameter. When the ```execute()``` method is called, the ```open()``` method will be used to visit the attacker-controlled URL, which could execute the malicious code on the server.

# How to fix?
To prevent this type of attack, it is important to carefully validate and sanitize all input parameters, and to avoid using potentially dangerous methods such as ```open()``` unless they are absolutely necessary. It may also be necessary to implement additional security measures, such as input filtering and whitelisting, to prevent attackers from supplying malicious URLs.
