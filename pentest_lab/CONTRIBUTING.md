# Contributing Guidelines

I'd love to accept your patches! Before I can take them, read and stick to the
[CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Commit Messages

Write your commit message in the imperative: “Fix bug” and not “Fixed bug” or
“Fixes bug.” This convention matches up with commit messages generated by
commands like git merge and git revert.

Commit messages consit of the following:

- A subject wich containing the title of the commit. 50 characters max.
- A explanatory description of what has been changed. Wrap the text at 72
  characters.

See following example:

```commit-message
Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.
In some contexts, the first line is treated as the subject of an email
and the rest of the text as the body.
The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
you omit the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you
run the two together.

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not
"Fixed bug"
 or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages generated
by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by
  a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary
  here

- Use a hanging indent
```

The above is taken from the Medium post: [How To Write Proper Git Commit
Messages](https://medium.com/@steveamaza/how-to-write-a-proper-git-commit-message-e028865e5791).

```markdown
