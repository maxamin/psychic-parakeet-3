# Code of Conduct

IT should be a warm welcoming inclusive space. So will be this project. In order
to keep up with this requirement this code of conduct was created.

## Be excellent to each other

Being a kind person is a must. This is not discussable. The following tries to
be a short explanation of "kind".

- **Be radically inclusive** to everyone - just plain everyone.
- **Be extraordinary respectful** of each others abilities, interests, and
  personal differences.
- **Be exceedingly kind** even in moments of disagreement while working towards
  consensus.
- **Be absolutely educative** to others with something you know more about.
- **Be open to feedback** from others in the community, be it technical skill or
  interpersonally.

These traits build the foundation of being part of this community.

This community is a place of diversity an equality.

## Be a nice person

The following are behaviors that are known to exclude and make other
demographics of people feel unwelcome. Please do not do the following.

### Don't be offensive

If you think you are offending someone for whatever reason, STOP immediately.
If you're uncertain, ask a core community member (in private message). Asking
for guidance will show good faith that you are striving to uphold our code of
conduct.

### Don't discriminate against anyone

Please be especially sensitive and aware of others who are different from you.
Don't make jokes, offhand comments, or name your projects in ways that can be
offensive relating to, but not limited to, the following topics

- Age
- Culture
- Ethnicity
- Gender identity & expression
- Nationality
- Physical disabilities or differences
- Mental disabilities or differences
- Politics
- Race
- Religion
- Sex
- Sexual orientation
- Socio-economic status
- Subcultural affiliation

Discriminatory comments or naming of projects that relate to any of the above
topics are the most common forms of abuse. Thus we consider violations relating
to these topics to be severe violations of our code of conduct.

### Don't sexualize your work

This is another tricky point as some people see no harm in naming a code
libraries things like `bikini.js` or `crotchlessChaps.js` or `fat-man.rb` or
leaving comments in their code like `A sexy ass variadic function`. These little
things may seem harmless, but can make others of different orientations,
ideologies, or life experiences feel very uncomfortable. It is best to avoid
such things as:

- Don't use overtly sexual usernames, or project names
- Don't refer to others in a sexualized way
- Refrain from comments with sexual undertones and metaphors

### Don't make unwelcome sexual advances

Most of our community are adults and should know when it's ok to flirt with
other adults. However, we're also an online community whereby many people don't
know each other in real life. Many of us come from different cultures. What
might be seen as lighthearted flirting in one culture, might be extremely
offensive to another culture. This discomfort causes people to not participate
in communities. Therefore it's best to not do it.

## Reporting violations

If you are aware of a violation of our code of conduct. Please contact one of
our core contributors such as:

- Olli (`oliver.wiegers at gmail.com`)

And they will investigate as soon as possible. If you would like to remain
anonymous in the report, please note this.

## Restrictions

Nothing of the above applies to Nazis, Sexists or other harmful People. This
community will not be tolerant to or the home to harmful people. Nazis are not
welcome.
To clarify: If you think you are better than any other human being, leave. You
are not welcome.
