                VulnerableApp-Facade was started when we were building
                 
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/SasanLabs/owasp-zap-fileupload-addon"
                >
                  File-upload addon
                </a>
                 
                for 
                <a
                  href="https://www.zaproxy.org/"
                >
                  Owasp ZAP
                </a>
                , which is used to find the vulnerabilities in the File Upload functionality. As we were developing the addon and writing the scan rules, in order to test those scan rules we were using
                 
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/SasanLabs/VulnerableApp"
                >
                  Owasp VulnerableApp
                </a>
                 
                but as Owasp VulnerableApp is written in Java and is a SpringBoot application hence testing scan rules related to PHP, ASP, JSP etc are not possible. Hence we thought of building a facade application which acts as proxy or gateway to route the requests to vulnerable applications written in different tech stacks.
