              As we are seeing a lot of technological enhancements in the industry from past few years, these technical enhancements are solving one or the other problem however, with that they also bring few different vulnerabilities. Vulnerable Applications are generally written in one of the techstacks like either Node.js or Java with a SQL or NoSQL database etc and hence they are not able to expand to a whole new set of vulnerabilities which are present in other technologies. Also adding more vulnerabilities in a single vulnerable application makes it heavier and complex which finally makes it unmaintainable. So VulnerableApp-facade is built to solve this problem by building a distributed farm of Vulnerable Applications such that they can be built agnostic to tech stacks.
              <p>
                Following is the design diagram of Owasp VulnerableApp-Facade:
              </p>
              <img
                alt="Unable to lead the design diagram"
                src="/images/VulnerableApp-facade.jpeg"
                width="80%"
              />
              <p>
                Here VulnerableApp-Facade is running as a gateway or a proxy which is routing calls to actual Vulnerable Applications based on a criteria defined in the nginx configuration.

              As VulnerableApp-Facade is a proxy wrapper over the actual Vulnerable Applications which can be very dangerous if exposed over the public internet. So we suggest you to please run it in local dev environments or environments without any public internet access.
