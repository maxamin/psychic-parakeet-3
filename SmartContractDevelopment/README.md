# Get Started

 ## Introduction
 
No matter if you are a beginner programmer or if you’ve been coding for years, this guide will provide resources for all levels of expertise. If there is something that you already know feel free to skip the material or use it as an opportunity to review what you already know and potentially fill in some gaps in your understanding.

Blockchain development might seem very intimidating at first, there are many moving parts, foundational knowledge from various different fields is required, the technologies are constantly evolving and aren’t as mature as in other areas of development such as in the web development space, there is a financial aspect to almost every application as you are programming on top of a value layer, etc. However, it is not as hard as you might think. Once you get familiarized with the basics, understanding everything else that is going on is usually just a matter of applying a general understanding to a specific situation. If you build a strong foundation then it will be much easier to process more complex topics and reason about problems relating to a new subject matter.

If you have a background in computer science, mathematics, or any related field, then you will have a much easier time getting started with blockchain development as many foundational concepts are abstractions of algorithms and data structures. If you are a complete beginner then please make sure you take the initial few steps with patience so as to not feel overwhelmed. Once you start familiarizing yourself with the material you will start to feel like it is more manageable.
