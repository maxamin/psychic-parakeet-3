### Understanding "Bridge Exploits"

A bridge is a tool that allows for communication between two different blockchain networks. Bridge hacks occur when attackers gain entry to one network and use it to access other connected networks through the bridge. This allows attackers to move laterally through the environment and access valuable assets on different blockchain networks.

### Example:

In 2021, the Poly Network, a decentralized finance platform, was hacked through a vulnerability in its smart contract. The attackers were able to steal over $600 million worth of cryptocurrencies across three different blockchains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon. The attackers used the stolen funds to create new smart contracts on each of the three blockchains to move the stolen assets around, making it more difficult to track and recover the funds.

# Mitigation:

To prevent bridge hacks, it is important to secure both ends of the bridge and ensure that communication between the two blockchain networks is secure. This can be achieved through measures such as implementing secure smart contracts, using multi-signature wallets, and conducting regular security audits.

It is also important to monitor for any suspicious activity and have a plan in place to respond to any potential breaches quickly.
