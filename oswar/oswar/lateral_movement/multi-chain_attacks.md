# 1. Multi-Chain Attacks

### What are "Multichain attacks"?

A "multichain attack" occurs when an attacker gains access to one blockchain network or dApp and then uses that access to pivot to other connected blockchain networks or dApps. This allows the attacker to move laterally through the environment and access valuable assets.

Within a lateral movement, multichain attacks refer to an attack tactic where an adversary gains access to one blockchain network or dApp, then moves laterally across multiple connected blockchain networks or dApps to reach their ultimate target. This tactic allows attackers to broaden their attack surface and access valuable assets across multiple blockchain networks.

### Example

An example of a multichain attack within the lateral movement could involve an attacker gaining access to and exploiting a bug in a decentralized exchange (DEX) on one blockchain network and then using that access/bug exploit to pivot to other connected chains.

### Mitigation

To mitigate multichain attacks within the lateral movement, it is important to implement strong access controls and monitoring tools to detect and prevent unauthorized access and movement within blockchain networks. This includes using multi-factor authentication, implementing network segmentation to restrict lateral movement, and conducting regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential weaknesses. Additionally, organizations should consider implementing blockchain-specific security solutions, such as smart contract audits and token whitelisting, to reduce the risk of multichain attacks within the lateral movement.
