# What are "compromised nodes"?

Compromised nodes are nodes within a blockchain network that an attacker has gained control of, often through a vulnerability or misconfiguration. Once an attacker has control of a node, they can use it to pivot to other nodes or systems within the same network, giving them access to valuable assets.

This access can allow attackers to move laterally through the environment and manipulate the network.

## Example

For instance, an attacker who gains control of a node in a DeFi protocol can access the protocol's smart contracts and execute transactions on the protocol's behalf. This enables them to move laterally within the protocol's network and gain access to valuable assets such as user funds, governance tokens, or private data.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the risk of compromised nodes, it is crucial to have a strong security posture in place. This includes regularly updating software and patches, using strong passwords, and limiting access to sensitive systems. Additionally, monitoring network traffic and system logs can help detect any suspicious activity and enable prompt response. Implementing a defense-in-depth approach, which involves layering multiple security mechanisms to prevent and detect attacks, is also recommended. This can include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, security information, and Rreal-time analysis tools.
