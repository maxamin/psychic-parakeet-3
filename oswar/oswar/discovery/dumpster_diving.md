### What is Dumpster Diving?

Dumpster diving is a technique used in social engineering that involves searching through an organization's trash or recycling for sensitive information. In the context of Web3, dumpster diving can be used to find information such as notes containing private keys, wallet addresses, and other resources that can be used to facilitate an attack. Attackers can use this method to gather information about their target and plan an attack.

### Example:

For instance, a hacker might have accessed a DApp developer's computer. In this situation, they may use other discovery strategies, like dumpster diving, to uncover more information to aid them in their attack. This scenario is part of the discovery phase since the hacker is still seeking to gather more information, even though they have already hacked into the victim's computer.

### Mitigation:

Organizations should dispose of sensitive information appropriately to reduce the risk of dumpster diving. This can include shredding documents that contain sensitive information and destroying hard drives and other storage devices that are no longer needed. It is also essential to educate employees about the risks of dumpster diving and implement security protocols that limit the amount of sensitive information available physically. Finally, organizations should consider using encryption and other security measures to protect sensitive data, even if it is accidentally disposed of.
