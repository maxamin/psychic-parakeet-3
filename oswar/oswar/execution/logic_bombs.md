What is "Logic Bombs" in Web3?

Deployment of malicious smart contract contract

Logic bombs" refer to malicious code (smart contracts) or programs intentionally inserted into software or system by a hacker to execute a harmful action when a specific trigger condition is met.

In the context of Web3, a logic bomb can be a type of smart contract vulnerability where a certain piece of code is designed to execute an attack or steal funds when a particular condition is met, such as when a specific date or time is reached, or when a particular transaction occurs. For example, a malicious actor could create a smart contract with a logic bomb triggered when a specific user or address interacts with the contract, allowing the attacker to steal funds from that user.

Example

Logic bombs" can be deployed in various ways, including through a hacker's own created smart contract. It involves inserting malicious code into a program or smart contract that will execute when certain conditions are met, such as a specific date, time, or event. The code can then carry out malicious actions, such as stealing funds or causing the smart contract to behave unexpectedly.

A malicious smart contract that interacts with a dApp smart contract can be labeled as a logic bomb if designed to carry out a destructive action at a specific time or under specific conditions. 

For example, a malicious smart contract that appears to provide a legitimate service but is designed to trigger a destructive action when a certain condition is met, such as when a specific address interacts with the contract, could be considered a logic bomb.

Mitigation:

To mitigate the risk of logic bombs in Web3, it is most important to monitor smart contracts proactively with real-time monitoring. This will enable developers and protocol founders to detect malicious deployments and interactions, thereby giving them a chance to detect to prevent devastating damage. 

Several on-chain & real-time monitoring solutions exist today, like Cyvers, Forta & Lossless.
