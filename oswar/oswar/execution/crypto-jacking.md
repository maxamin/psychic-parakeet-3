What is crypto-jacking?

Crypto-jacking is a cyber-attack where malicious actors use a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrency without their knowledge or consent. This attack is usually achieved by injecting a script into a website or a software program, which runs in the background without the user's knowledge or consent. The attacker benefits by receiving the mined cryptocurrency, while the victim suffers from the degraded performance of their device and increased energy consumption.

Example:

An example of crypto-jacking is the Coinhive script, which was widely used by cybercriminals to mine Monero cryptocurrency by exploiting the computing power of users who visited compromised websites. Another example is the XMRig malware, which infects computers and mobile devices to mine Monero.

Mitigation:

To prevent crypto-jacking, users can take the following measures:

1. Install ad-blocking and anti-malware software: These tools can detect and block crypto-jacking scripts before they can infect your device.
2. Use a browser extension: Some browser extensions, like NoCoin can prevent crypto-jacking scripts from running on your device.
3. Keep your software up-to-date: Cryptojackers often exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software. Regularly updating your software can help prevent these attacks.
4. Be cautious of suspicious links and downloads: Crypto-jacking malware can be hidden in phishing emails, malicious websites, and software downloads. Be wary of any suspicious links or downloads, and only download software from trusted sources.
5. Monitor your device's performance: If it is running slower than usual or consuming more energy, it may be a sign of crypto-jacking. Monitor your device's performance and investigate any suspicious activity.
