What is “Entropu Illusion”?

The Entropy Illusion vulnerability occurs when a blockchain application generates random numbers with insufficient entropy, which can lead to predictable or easily guessable numbers. This can compromise the security of cryptographic operations, such as private key generation or cryptographic signatures, which rely on unpredictable random numbers for their strength.

All transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are deterministic state transition operations. Meaning that every transaction modifies the global state of the Ethereum ecosystem, and it does so in a calculable way with no uncertainty. This ultimately means no source of entropy or randomness inside the blockchain ecosystem.

Example:

A real-world example of the Entropy Illusion vulnerability is the case of the Android Bitcoin Wallet, which was found to use a predictable source of entropy for generating Bitcoin addresses. This made it possible for attackers to predict the addresses generated by the wallet and steal the bitcoins associated with those addresses.

Mitigation

To mitigate the Entropy Illusion vulnerability, developers should ensure that their blockchain applications use enough random number generators or trusted external sources of randomness. Additionally, developers should use well-established cryptographic libraries to generate secure random numbers. It is also recommended to periodically review the source code of blockchain applications to identify potential vulnerabilities and to apply security patches promptly.
