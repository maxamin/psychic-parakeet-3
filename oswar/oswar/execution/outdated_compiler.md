# 5.23 Outdated Compiler

What is an outdated compiler?

An outdated compiler in the database for Web3 refers to an older version of the Solidity programming language compiler, which is used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Solidity is a programming language that enables the development of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The compiler is responsible for translating Solidity code into bytecode that can be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

As with any software, newer versions of the Solidity compiler are regularly released to fix bugs, improve performance, and introduce new features. An outdated compiler may have security vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit, leading to potential loss of funds or other unintended consequences.

Example

The issue with an outdated compiler would be that it does not include security fixes for known vulnerabilities or may need certain security features added in more recent versions. This could make smart contracts written with an outdated compiler more susceptible to attacks.

- No real-world example was found.

Mitigation

The mitigation for an outdated compiler is to update to a recent version of the Solidity compiler. This can be done by downloading the latest compiler version from the official Solidity website or using a package manager like npm or yarn. It is recommended to regularly update the Solidity compiler to ensure the security and reliability of smart contracts running on the Ethereum blockchain.
