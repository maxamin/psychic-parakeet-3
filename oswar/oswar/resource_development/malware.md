### What is “Malware”?

Malware within resource development involves acquiring malware to target the infrastructure in resource development. Various forms of malware exist, and some are purchased on the darkweb. The forms of malware in this section are traditional “Web2” malware & software. Here, it is malware which is dedicated to acquire resources like the private key. 

Malware is short for malicious software, which is designed to infiltrate and damage computer systems without the owner's consent or knowledge. Malware can take many forms, including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. It can be spread through various means, including email attachments, infected software, compromised websites, or social engineering.

2. Install reputable antivirus and antimalware software and keep it updated.
3. Use strong and unique passwords for all accounts and enable two-factor authentication wherever possible.
4. Educate employees on recognizing and avoiding phishing scams and other social engineering tactics.
5. Regularly back up important data to an external source.
6. Monitor network traffic and system logs for signs of unusual activity.
7. Implement a least privilege policy to limit access to sensitive data and systems.
8. Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and address security weaknesses.

By following these best practices, individuals and organizations can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to malware attacks.
