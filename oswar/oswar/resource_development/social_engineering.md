### What is "Social Engineering"?

Social engineering is a technique used by cybercriminals to trick people into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise their security. It involves manipulating individuals into giving away confidential information or performing actions that may put their security and privacy at risk. Social engineering uses psychological manipulation to trick victims into revealing sensitive information. In the context of Web3, blockchains, and crypto, social engineering can be used to gain access to social media accounts, email accounts, and other resources that can be used to support an attack.

### Example:

A phishing attack is a common example of social engineering in the web3 context. Phishing attacks usually involve an attacker pretending to be a trustworthy entity, such as a cryptocurrency exchange, and tricking the victim into providing sensitive information, such as their login credentials or private keys. In a web3 phishing attack, the attacker may also request or fetch the victim's wallet address, private key, or other sensitive data.

Pretexting is another technique used in social engineering. It involves creating a false scenario or pretext to gain the victim's trust and extract information. For instance, an attacker may pose as a bank employee, call a customer and request sensitive information, such as their social security number or credit card details, claiming that their account has been compromised.

This happened in the second stage of the Coinbase phishing event:

> 
> 
> *The second phase of the attack began with a phone call to the employee’s mobile phone, with the attacker claiming to be a Coinbase’s corporate Information Technology (IT) team member.*
> 
> *Trusting that the caller was a legitimate **[Coinbase](https://www.hackread.com/tag/Coinbase/)** IT staff member, the employee logged into their workstation and followed the attacker’s instructions. However, the employee grew increasingly suspicious of the requests as the conversation progressed.*
> 
> *Thankfully, the employee’s suspicions were enough to prevent damage. No funds were taken, and no customer information was accessed or viewed during the incident.*
> 
> *Based on the attacker’s modus operandi, Coinbase believes the incident was not an isolated one and is linked to a series of cyberattacks that have taken place recently, including **[Twilio](https://www.hackread.com/hackers-employee-accounts-twilio-internal-system/)**, **[DoorDash](https://www.hackread.com/doordash-data-breach-third-party-phishing-attack/)**, **[Zendesk](https://www.hackread.com/sms-phishing-scam-dupes-zendesk-staff/)**, **[Namecheap](https://www.hackread.com/hackers-crypto-wallets-namecheap-phishing/)** and others.”*

Another example of pretexting is when an attacker poses as an IT support representative and calls an employee, claiming that their computer has been infected with a virus and they need to install a remote access tool to fix the issue. The remote access tool is actually malware that allows the attacker to gain access to the victim's system and steal sensitive data.

Overall, social engineering attacks can take various forms, and it is essential to be cautious and vigilant about any unexpected or suspicious requests for information or actions.

The last example of social engineering is swapping. In this attack, the attacker convinces the victim's mobile carrier to transfer the victim's phone number to a new SIM card, which the attacker controls. Once the attacker has control over the victim's phone number, they can reset passwords, receive 2FA codes, and gain access to the victim's accounts.

### Mitigation:

To mitigate social engineering attacks, web3 users should be cautious of unsolicited messages, links, or requests, especially those requesting sensitive information. It is essential to verify the authenticity of any request before providing sensitive information or performing any action that may put their security and privacy at risk.

Users should also use two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible, which adds an extra layer of security to their accounts (sim cards are less secure, as mentioned). Additionally, users should keep their software and systems up-to-date with the latest security patches and use antivirus and firewall software to protect their devices from malware and other threats.

Lastly, education and awareness are crucial to prevent social engineering attacks, and users should be educated on the latest tactics used by attackers to trick them into giving away sensitive information or performing harmful actions.
