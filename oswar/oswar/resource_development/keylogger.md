### What is "Keylogger"?

A keylogger is malware designed to capture keystrokes on a target's computer. This can be used to steal private keys by recording the keys used to unlock wallets or access other Web3 platforms.

Keyloggers, also known as keystroke loggers or keystroke recorders, are types of malware that record every keystroke a user makes on a computer or mobile device. This can include sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, private keys, and other data that can be used to carry out cyber-attacks or steal cryptocurrency.

Keyloggers can be either hardware or software-based, with software keyloggers being more common in modern times. They can be installed on a device via phishing attacks, malicious downloads, or other means and can run in the background without the user's knowledge.

### Example

Sources have come forth alleging that the 2022 Lastpass hack event, whereby thousands if not millions of sensitive emails and passwords were “leaked” or compromised, occurred due to a keylogger hack targeting an employee. The company lost encrypted password vault data for all customers to a hacker secretly poking around LastPass’ systems for weeks.

*“In Monday’s [update(Opens in a new window)](https://support.lastpass.com/help/incident-2-additional-details-of-the-attack), LastPass added that only four [DevOps](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/devops) engineers at the company possessed the necessary decryption keys through a “highly restricted set of shared folders.” However, the hacker circumvented the company’s security safeguards by serving malware to one of the DevOps engineers at their home.*

*“This was accomplished by targeting the DevOps engineer’s home computer and exploiting a vulnerable third-party media software package, which enabled remote code execution capability and allowed the threat actor to implant keylogger malware,” LastPass said.”*

### Mitigation

To mitigate the risk of keyloggers, users should follow basic cybersecurity practices and implement malware detection software, avoiding suspicious downloads and links and using two-factor authentication for all accounts. Users can use anti-malware software that includes keylogger detection and removal capabilities to protect their devices from this type of malware.
