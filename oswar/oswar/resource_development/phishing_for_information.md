### What is "Phishing for Information"?

Phishing for information is the practice of tricking targets into revealing sensitive information through deceptive emails, social media messages, or other communications. In the context of Web3, phishing attacks can be used to steal private keys, wallet addresses, and other valuable resources that can be used to support an attack. Phishing is a common attack vector and can be used in different stages of an attack.

In the context of resource development, phishing is primarily used to obtain more information rather than the actual private key, as the hacker may not be aware of which validator or person holds the private key.

### Example

A real-world example of phishing for information in Web3 is the event where Coinbase employees received a phishing SMS on their phones. The phishing link sought to gather access to sensitive information from the Coinbase staff.

> It all started on Sunday, February 5, 2023, when several Coinbase employees received text messages asking them to use the link sent by the attacker for an urgent login. While all recipients ignored the text, one employee logged in with their username and password.
> 
> 
> With the help of the employee’s login credentials, the attacker attempted to access Coinbase’s internal network. However, since the company had enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA) for employees, the attacker could not bypass the security feature and could not proceed further even after several attempts.
> 
> While the attacker was unsuccessful in accessing Coinbase’s system, a limited amount of data from the company’s directory was exposed, including names, email addresses, and phone numbers of a limited number of employees.
> 
> **The Call**
> 
> The second phase of the attack began with a phone call to the employee’s mobile phone, with the attacker claiming to be a member of Coinbase’s corporate Information Technology (IT) team.
> 
> Trusting that the caller was a legitimate Coinbase IT staff member, the employee logged into their workstation and followed the attacker’s instructions. However, as the conversation progressed, the employee grew increasingly suspicious of the requests.
> 
> Thankfully, the employee’s suspicions were enough to prevent damage. No funds were taken, and no customer information was accessed or viewed during the incident.
> 
> Based on the attacker’s modus operandi, Coinbase believes the incident was not an isolated one and is linked to a series of cyberattacks that have taken place recently, including Twilio, DoorDash, Zendesk, Namecheap, and others.

### Mitigation

To protect against phishing attacks, Web3 users can take several measures, including:

- **Using anti-phishing browser extensions:** Browser extensions, such as those for MetaMask and MyEtherWallet, can detect and block phishing websites and messages.
- **Verifying URLs:** Users should verify the URL of the website they are visiting, especially when dealing with sensitive information.
- **Avoiding clicking on suspicious links:** Users should avoid clicking on links in emails or messages from unknown senders or messages that seem too good to be true.
- **Enabling two-factor authentication:** Two-factor authentication can add an extra layer of security to users' accounts and prevent attackers from gaining access even if they have the user's password.
- **Educating users:** Educating users about the risks of phishing attacks and how to identify and avoid them can help prevent successful attacks.
