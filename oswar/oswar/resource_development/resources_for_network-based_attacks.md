### What are "Resources for network-based attacks?"

"Resources for network-based attacks" refer to the tools, techniques, and strategies that attackers can use to compromise the security of a network, such as a blockchain network. These resources may include software vulnerabilities, malware, social engineering tactics, brute force attacks, denial-of-service attacks, and other similar methods.

The most commonly used consensus mechanisms within blockchain networks are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). For an attacker to take control of these distributed consensus networks, they must acquire enough computing power in the form of hash-rate or enough tokens within a token's circulating supply.

### Example

An example of an attack that exploits network vulnerabilities is the 51% attack on a blockchain network. In this type of attack, an attacker needs to gain control of the majority of the network's computing power or tokens, enabling them to manipulate the blockchain's ledger and transactions. While any PoS or PoW-based network is theoretically vulnerable to such an attack, executing on well-established blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin is extremely difficult.

### Mitigation

Blockchain networks need to be as decentralized as possible to prevent such attacks. The issue arises with the introduction of decentralization and decentralized consensus. Various networks have different degrees of percentage when it comes to being able to take over the network. Some have it as high as 2/3, meaning 66%. If a network has been 51% attacked, there is not much to do to prevent it. It will often just result in a network fork. There will be two chains, and then the community needs to decide which “correct” chain is.
