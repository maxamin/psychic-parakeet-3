### What is "Credential Stuffing"?

Credential stuffing is a technique cybercriminals use to gain unauthorized access to a target's account by using stolen login credentials. This can be used to steal private keys by accessing the target's Web3 wallet or other cryptocurrency-related accounts. Cybercriminals exploit the vulnerability of reused or weak passwords across different accounts to execute this type of cyberattack. Credential stuffing attacks involve automated attempts to log into a target's account using combinations of usernames and passwords obtained from data breaches and other sources. Resource development involves acquiring the credential stuffing tool to carry out the attack.

Credential stuffing is a popular technique among cybercriminals because it requires minimal effort to execute and can lead to significant financial gain. In the context of Web3 security, credential stuffing can be used to access a target's Web3 wallet or other cryptocurrency-related accounts, enabling the attacker to steal private keys and access funds.

### Example

In 2019, a hacker group compromised 4.9 million Capital One credit card applications by exploiting a vulnerability in the company's firewall. The attackers then used a credential-stuffing attack to access the AWS server containing the stolen data. The attack resulted in the theft of personal information, including names, addresses, credit scores, and Social Security numbers of the affected individuals.

### Mitigation

Organizations can implement several measures to mitigate credential-stuffing attacks, such as strong password policies that require users to create complex passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA). Other best practices include monitoring for unusual login attempts and implementing rate-limiting mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks. Additionally, organizations can use third-party services to monitor and alert them of compromised credentials, allowing them to prompt affected users to change their passwords. Finally, educating users on the dangers of password reuse and encouraging them to use unique passwords across different accounts is essential.
