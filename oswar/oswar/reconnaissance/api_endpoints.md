# 4. API endpoints

### What are API endpoints?

API endpoints are a key target for reconnaissance, as they can provide valuable information about the dApp's functionality and underlying blockchain network. An API endpoint is a URL that can be accessed to interact with a specific component of the dApp, such as a smart contract or a node on the blockchain network. 

### Example

An attacker may use an API endpoint to gather information about a smart contract's functions and input parameters, which could reveal vulnerabilities that can be exploited to manipulate or steal assets from the contract.

### Mitigation

To mitigate the risk of reconnaissance attacks, dApp developers should take several steps. First, they should ensure that sensitive information is not exposed through API endpoints, such as private keys or other authentication credentials. Developers should also ensure the API keys are secure. 

- Developers can also implement rate limiting and IP blocking to prevent automated reconnaissance attacks.

Additionally, developers can use obfuscation techniques to make it more difficult for attackers to extract information from API endpoints, such as using random identifiers for function names or input parameters. Finally, developers should regularly audit their dApp and blockchain networks for potential vulnerabilities and implement patches to stay ahead of attackers.
