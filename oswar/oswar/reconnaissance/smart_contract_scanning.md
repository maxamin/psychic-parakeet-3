### What is “smart contract scanning”?

Smart contract scanning involves analyzing the open-source code of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code on a blockchain, to identify any potential security vulnerabilities. 

### Example

A real-world example of why smart contract scanning is important is the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) hack in 2016. The DAO was a decentralized venture capital fund that raised over $150 million worth of ether, a cryptocurrency used on the Ethereum blockchain. However, a DAO's smart contract code flaw was exploited, allowing an attacker to drain approximately $50 million worth of ether. The hack resulted in a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain, where a new version was created to reverse the transactions and return the stolen funds.

This is not the only example. All hacks occur due to a vulnerability of the smart contracts that have at some point been scanned and identified by the hacker. 

### Mitigation

It is not possible to prevent the “scanning” of blockchain smart contracts which are open source.

However, one should perform smart contract audits and bug bounties to mitigate the risk of being hacked. This involves using tools and techniques to analyze the smart contract code for any weaknesses or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. The goal is to identify potential issues before malicious actors can exploit them.

In addition to audits, dApps should implement proactive real-time monitoring to scan for malicious activity. This involves AI-based & Machine learning monitoring solutions that scan smart contracts and entire blockchain networks to identify malicious smart contracts being deployed.
