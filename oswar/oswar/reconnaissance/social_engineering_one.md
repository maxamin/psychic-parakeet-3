### What is “social engineering”?

Social engineering is the use of psychological manipulation to deceive victims into divulging sensitive information, such as private keys, seed phrases, or passwords. Cybercriminals use this technique to gain unauthorized access to victims' crypto wallets or personal information.

### Example

An example of social engineering in the context of Web3 is pretexting. Pretexting is a tactic where an attacker creates a false identity or scenario to gain the victim's trust and extract sensitive information.

For instance, a hacker may impersonate an IT technician and contact an employee to request their login credentials, claiming that there is an issue with their account that needs to be resolved. The attacker may use these credentials to access the company's network or steal sensitive data.

Another form of pretexting occurs when an attacker calls a company's customer service department, pretending to be a customer, and convinces the representative to provide them with confidential information or access to the customer's account.

A real-world example is the North-Korean Lazarus group, who sent malicious PDFs to Web3 project owners on LinkedIn, pretending to be someone else.

*”Lazarus Group has been one of the most persistent and dangerous hackers in the cryptocurrency space. In addition to the Ronin bridge exploit, which earned them over $500 million, the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group carried out several other profitable attacks in 2022. Some of the ones that stand out are the [Gate.io](http://gate.io/) exploit and the Harmony Horizon bridge attack. The Lazarus Group ran a fraudulent job advertisement scheme. They posted job openings on sites like LinkedIn and told people who were interested to download a PDF file that had an executable file inside. This malware enabled Lazarus operatives to exploit vulnerabilities in the victim's system, stealing sensitive data from employees at existing crypto companies.”*

### Mitigation

To mitigate the risk of social engineering attacks, it is important to be cautious and vigilant when receiving unsolicited emails or messages. Always verify the sender's authenticity and double-check the URL of any websites you are prompted to visit.

Additionally, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts that support it, and avoid sharing your private keys or seed phrases with anyone, including friends and family. Finally, consider using a hardware wallet to store your crypto assets, as these devices provide an extra layer of security against social engineering attacks.

To prevent pretexting attacks, organizations can implement strict policies for verifying the identity of individuals who request sensitive information or access. This may involve requiring additional authentication measures, such as passwords or biometric data, or conducting background checks on individuals who request access to sensitive systems. Additionally, employee training and awareness programs can help to educate staff on how to recognize and avoid social engineering attacks.
