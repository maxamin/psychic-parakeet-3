What is a “Contract Ownership Change”?

Contract Ownership Change is a type of attack in the context of decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum blockchain or other Web3 platforms. A smart contract is a self-executing program that runs on the blockchain and can manage assets and transactions without a centralized authority. In this type of attack, an attacker changes the ownership of a smart contract, granting them full control over it. This can allow them to modify or destroy the contract, steal funds or data, or execute other malicious actions. 

In this type of attack, the attacker gains control over the ownership of a smart contract, either by exploiting a vulnerability in the contract code or by gaining access to the private keys of the contract owner. Once the attacker becomes the contract owner, they can execute any contract function, including modifying its code, stealing funds or data, or destroying the contract entirely. The change of contract ownership enables the attacker to establish a real foothold within the DApp/protocol.

Example:

Imagine a dApp that manages a decentralized exchange where users can trade cryptocurrencies. The smart contract that powers the exchange has a function that allows the contract owner to withdraw all the funds held in the exchange. If an attacker gains control over the contract ownership, they can call this function and steal all the funds stored in the exchange.

Mitigation

To mitigate Contract Ownership Changes attacks, dApp developers should follow security best practices when coding their contracts, such as using established security frameworks, conducting thorough code audits, and implementing multi-signature mechanisms for critical functions. Additionally, dApp users should be cautious when interacting with smart contracts and only use trusted applications thoroughly audited and reviewed by the community. 

The best tip, in this case, would be to implement real-time and proactive monitoring of the contract owner wallet, which essentially is the key central access to the entire dApp/protocol. Real-time monitoring can prevent the entire ownership by alerting the owner contract dApp/protocol in real time. It could even front-run the entire transaction by detecting it in the mempool. 
Real-time monitoring can also, in this case, be used to prevent further harm once the attacker has managed to establish his foothold and gain access to the wallet.
