What is a “backdoor”?

One example of a persistence attack in Web3 where a hacker gains complete control over a network, or dApp is a "backdoor" attack. This attack involves inserting a hidden access point, or "backdoor," into a network or application that allows the attacker to bypass normal authentication and gain complete control over the system.

In a blockchain context, a backdoor could be inserted into the smart contract code, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the blockchain and manipulate its state. For example, the attacker could create new transactions, transfer funds, or change the ownership of assets without the knowledge or consent of the legitimate users of the blockchain.

Backdoors are secret entry points to a system or software that allow unauthorized access. In the context of Web3, backdoors can be used to gain persistent access to a smart contract, wallet, or other decentralized application, enabling attackers to steal funds or data.

Example

Not so common in the crypto world, especially DeFi; we may have a huge example in CeFi. Rumors had it that the FTX collapsed, not due to a private key, but due to a backdoor established inside FTX system by SBF himself.

Mitigation

Web3 technology is still evolving, and while it offers many advantages over traditional web technologies, it also presents new security challenges. Backdoors are one such challenge that remains a challenge, and they can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to web3 systems and exploit vulnerabilities for their own purposes. Here are some ways to mitigate backdoors in web3. 

It is also important to ensure all developers in a project are to be trusted. They can implement malicious code intentionally, without authority. 

Backdoors can actually be introduced unintentionally during the development process. By following secure development practices, such as using secure coding techniques, conducting regular code reviews, and performing thorough testing, you can reduce the risk of introducing backdoors into your web3 applications.

Follow best practices for smart contract development: Smart contracts are an integral part of many web3 applications and are through malicious smart contracts and/or loopholes that the backdoor access would be. It is, in this case, highly important to monitor and check the contracts for any backdoor access to unauthorized wallets.
