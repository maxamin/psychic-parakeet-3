### What is “Forged address phishing”?

Forged address phishing is a type of scam where an attacker creates a fake address that looks similar to a legitimate one and sends a small amount of cryptocurrency to the target's account from the fake address. This scam is similar to Zero Transfer Phishing, but instead of zero transfers, attackers use actual amounts. The attacker hopes that the target will mistake the fake address for the real one and copy it for a larger transaction, leading to the target mistakenly sending their cryptocurrency to the attacker's address instead of the intended recipient.

### Example

For example, let's say a user wants to transfer $50,000 worth of Ether to their friend's address, 0x123456789abcdef. The attacker monitors this transaction and creates a fake address that looks very similar, such as 0x123456789abcdee, and sends a small amount of Ether, say $0.1, from the fake address to the user's account. The attacker hopes that the user will copy the fake address instead of the real one when making the large transfer, leading to the user mistakenly sending the $50,000 worth of Ether to the attacker's address.

### Mitigation

To avoid falling for this type of phishing scam, users should always double-check the authenticity of the address they are sending funds, especially when dealing with large amounts of cryptocurrency. One way to do this is by comparing the first and last few characters of the address to ensure they match the intended recipient's address. Additionally, users can use secure communication channels, such as encrypted messaging or phone calls, to confirm the legitimacy of the recipient's address before sending any funds. Finally, it is essential to be aware of common cryptocurrency scams and stay vigilant against suspicious activity.

After the zero transfer scam, we find a new similar phishing method that is rampant nowadays!! Here is the summary:

1. After monitoring, a user initiates a large transfer to a particular address (usually above $10,000), and the scammer will forge an address highly similar to the previous transfer target. 
2. The scammer then sends a nominal amount, usually less than $0.1, to the user's account from this forged fake address. 
3. And if the user mistakenly believed that this small deposit came from the original transfer address and copied it. Oooooooop!!!! They fall for the phishing trap and transfer their money to the scammer.

This is a new type of phishing, similar to the previous "zero-transfer" scam. Stay vigilant and only readily copy the address of a small deposit after verifying its authenticity.
