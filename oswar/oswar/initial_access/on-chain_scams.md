### What are “On-chain Scams?”

On-chain Scams are a type of cyberattack that targets users of Web3 technology. In this case, attackers create a fake project or platform, such as a decentralized application (dApp) or a non-fungible token (NFT) mint, to lure victims into connecting their wallets. Once the victim connects their wallet, the malicious smart contract automatically drains the user's funds without their knowledge or consent.

### Example:

An attacker sets up a fraudulent NFT marketplace that imitates a popular and legitimate platform. They promote the fake marketplace through social media, forums, and email campaigns. Unsuspecting users, believing the marketplace to be legitimate, connect their Web3 wallets to the platform. Upon connecting, the malicious smart contract embedded in the fake marketplace executes, withdrawing funds from the connected wallets and transferring them to the attacker's wallet.

### Mitigation:

Verify platform legitimacy: Before connecting your wallet to a platform, ensure that it is a legitimate and trusted platform by checking its URL, reading reviews, checking etherscan, using smart contract reviewing tools, and seeking explanations of the smart contract from trusted sources.

Be cautious with links: Avoid clicking on links from unknown sources or that appear suspicious, and always double-check URLs before entering sensitive information.

Educate yourself: Stay informed about the latest security threats and best practices for safeguarding your digital assets. The more you know, the better you can protect yourself from phishing attacks and other types of cyber threats.
