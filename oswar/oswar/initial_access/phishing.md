## What is Phishing?

Phishing is a social engineering attack where an attacker poses as a legitimate entity or website to trick a victim into revealing sensitive information, like login credentials and personal data. Phishing is part of the "initial access" tactic within the framework for Web3.

The most common tactic for initial access to a Web3 network or platform is targeted phishing attacks, which aim to obtain a private key. These attacks may involve sending emails or messages that appear to be from a legitimate source to reveal information or download malware.

## Example

An example of a phishing attack in the context of Web3 could be a phishing link sent to a developer of a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform. The developer may be prompted to click on a link that downloads malware or keylogger on their computer.

## Mitigation

Organizations and individuals can take several steps to mitigate the risk of phishing attacks within the initial access tactic:

1. Educate users: Provide awareness training on identifying and avoiding phishing emails and websites. Encourage users to report suspicious messages to IT or security teams.
2. Implement email filters: Use email filtering software to block messages from known phishing domains. Identify and quarantine suspicious messages for review.
3. Enable two-factor authentication: Require users to use two-factor authentication (2FA) when accessing Web3 platforms and services to provide an additional layer of security and prevent unauthorized access.
4. Verify website URLs: Always check the URL of a website before entering login credentials or other sensitive information. Ensure it is a legitimate site and not a fake one.
5. Use security tools: Use web filters, firewalls, and anti-virus software to prevent access to malicious websites. Detect and block phishing attempts.
