### What is On-chain OSINT?

On-chain OSINT, another way of referencing blockchain OSINT is also known as "Open-Source Intelligence," which involves collecting and analyzing data from open sources, both covert and publicly available.

Since blockchain data, such as transactions, is publicly available, attackers can use blockchain analysis tools to trace transactions, identify wallet addresses, and uncover other sensitive data related to blockchain users. This technique is often used in the collection phase of a web3 hack. By using publicly available blockchain analysis tools, hackers can go through a lot of data to identify a protocol, DApp, or target in general.

### Example

Attackers can use blockchain analysis to track transactions and identify the parties involved, including wallet addresses and other sensitive data. This information can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the system, launch phishing attacks, or steal cryptocurrency. However, it can also be as simple as examining certain protocols' Total Value Locked (TVL) to further identify a target.

An attacker might use blockchain analysis to identify the owners of substantial amounts of cryptocurrency and then use social engineering techniques to trick them into revealing their private keys or other sensitive information. Additionally, attackers can collect information on dApps, such as their smart contract code, user data, transaction history, volume, and more.

### Mitigation

Unfortunately, it is not possible to prevent on-chain OSINT entirely because blockchain technology is designed to be transparent and decentralized. However, some measures can be taken to reduce the risk of attacks, such as using privacy-enhancing technologies like mixers or tumblers to obfuscate transactions and prevent tracking. Additionally, users can take steps to protect their private keys and other sensitive information, such as using hardware wallets or secure storage solutions.
