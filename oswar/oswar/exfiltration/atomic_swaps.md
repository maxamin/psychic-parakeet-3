### What are "Atomic Swaps"?

Atomic swaps are a type of decentralized technology that enables the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another without the need for a centralized exchange. While this technology can be exploited to obscure the flow of funds and parties involved in a transaction during the money laundering phase of an attack, it can also be used for legitimate purposes.

In a money laundering attack, a hacker might use atomic swaps to convert stolen cryptocurrency into a more privacy-focused cryptocurrency like Monero or Zcash. Doing so makes it more difficult for investigators to trace the stolen funds back to the original source.

Atomic swaps utilize smart contracts to create a trustless exchange between two parties. For example, a hacker could set up a smart contract to exchange their stolen Bitcoin for an equivalent amount of Monero without needing a centralized exchange or intermediary.

### Example:

In a money laundering attack, a hacker might exploit atomic swaps to convert stolen cryptocurrency into a more privacy-focused cryptocurrency like Monero or Zcash, making it difficult for investigators to trace the stolen funds back to the original source.

### Mitigation:

To mitigate the risk of atomic swaps being used for money laundering, cryptocurrency exchanges and financial institutions can implement robust anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) policies. They can also use blockchain analytics tools to monitor transactions and detect suspicious activity. Additionally, regulators can impose stricter regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges and financial institutions to prevent using atomic swaps for illicit purposes.
