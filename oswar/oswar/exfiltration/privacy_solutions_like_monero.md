# 1. Privacy solutions like Monero

### What is Monero?

One of the features that some blockchains offer is privacy through encryption and cryptography. Monero is a popular example of this.

Monero is a privacy-focused solution that uses advanced cryptography techniques to obscure transaction details, making it difficult to trace the source and destination of funds. It uses techniques like ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions to make transactions untraceable and un-linkable, offering enhanced privacy and anonymity to its users. This makes it an attractive option for those prioritizing privacy in their transactions. In fact, stolen assets are often converted to Monero and sent to other wallets anonymously due to their privacy features.

Another use case for Monero is in the context of exfiltration. Hackers may use Monero to receive payment for stolen data, as it allows them to conceal their identity and makes it difficult for law enforcement to track the funds.

### Example

Let's say a Web3 application on the Ethereum blockchain has been hacked, and funds have been stolen. To cover their tracks, a hacker might convert the assets to Monero and send them to anonymous wallet addresses. This is what's known as the "money laundering" phase of an attack.

### Mitigation

To mitigate the risk of exfiltration, organizations can implement strong access controls, encryption, and monitoring systems. However, privacy solutions like Monero have not been compromised and are available on exchanges, making it challenging to prevent exfiltration except on a centralized exchange actively.
