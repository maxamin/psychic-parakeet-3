### What is “private key” theft?

(This section does overlap with a lot of other sections.) Private keys are the main credentials used to access and manage Web3 assets, which include cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and smart contracts. Malicious actors may attempt to steal users' private keys through phishing, social engineering, or malware.

### Example

The Ronin Network hack of 2022 is an example of a Guardian Takeover attack.

Axie Infinity, a popular blockchain gaming application, was developed on the Ronin Network. Regrettably, Ronin experienced one of its worst hacks in March 2022, when a malicious actor rapidly obtained 173,600 ether ($ETH) and 25.5 million USDC, which were later exchanged for $625 million. The hacker acquired the necessary private keys and consequently stole all the funds from the Ronin Bridge in just two transactions, making it one of the most significant DeFi breaches.

The Ronin Bridge had nine "validators" operating it, with a five out of nine thresholds. Sky Mavis, the company behind Axie Infinity, oversaw four validators, so the private keys needed to be distributed more. Additionally, Axie delegated their validator's signature to Sky Mavis in November 2021. While this delegation was meant to be temporary due to the heavy traffic Axie was experiencing, it was never revoked. Sky Mavis ended up with five validator signatures, enough to approve any message. Through a social-engineering attack, the attacker gained control of the keys. They could call withdrawERC from the bridge without a backing transaction on the other side once they had the keys.

### Mitigation

Private key theft is a critical security issue in the blockchain and cryptocurrency world. It can result in the loss of funds and compromise the security of a blockchain network. Below are some practical ways to prevent private key theft while securing your crypto assets:

- Use a hardware wallet: A physical device stores your private keys offline, making it more challenging for hackers to access them. It is one of the most secure ways to store your private keys.
- Use a software wallet with two-factor authentication: If you use a software wallet to store your private keys, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of security. This will require a code generated by an app or text message in addition to your password to access your wallet.
- Use a strong password: Create a strong, unique password for your wallet and change it regularly. Avoid using easily guessable passwords, such as common words or phrases, birthdates, or pet names.
- Keep your private keys offline: Consider printing and storing them in a secure physical location, such as a safe or safety deposit box. This ensures that your private keys are not stored on a computer or device that can be hacked.
- Avoid phishing scams: Be wary of phishing scams that trick you into giving away your private keys. Only enter your private keys on trusted and secure websites.
- Regularly update your software: Keep your wallet software up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates to address any vulnerabilities.
- Use a multi-signature scheme: DApps can implement multi-signature schemes requiring multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. This adds an extra layer of security and reduces the risk of private key theft.

The best way to prevent private key theft is to stay vigilant and take proactive steps to secure your private keys. You can significantly reduce the risk of private key theft by using a combination of hardware and software wallets, two-factor authentication, strong passwords, offline storage, and regular updates.
