### What is chain hopping?

Chain hopping is a technique used by crypto money launderers to conceal the origin and destination of illicit funds. It involves moving funds from one cryptocurrency to another, often through multiple exchanges or wallets, to obscure the transaction trail.

The basic idea behind chain hopping is to make it more difficult for investigators to trace the flow of funds. By moving funds through multiple cryptocurrencies, it becomes much harder to establish a clear line of ownership and track the final destination of the funds. One of the primary advantages of chain hopping is that it allows money launderers to take advantage of the relatively low transaction fees and high liquidity of certain assets.

### Example

For example, hackers may use a low-fee cryptocurrency like Litecoin to move funds quickly and cheaply from wallet to wallet and then convert them into a more stable and widely accepted cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum, moving funds across chains and wallets multiple times to try to hide their tracks. Additionally, it can be used to obscure the source of illicit funds. By moving funds through multiple exchanges or wallets, money launderers can make it appear that the funds come from multiple sources rather than a single source.

The essence here is to move the funds as much as possible across chains so that it becomes difficult to trace.

### Mitigation

Despite the apparent advantages, chain hopping is not foolproof. Investigators can still use various techniques to trace the flow of funds, including analyzing blockchain data, monitoring exchanges, and conducting traditional financial investigations. Additionally, some cryptocurrencies make chain-hopping more difficult.

While chain hopping can be an effective tool for crypto money launderers, it is not without risks. As regulators and law enforcement agencies become more sophisticated in tracking cryptocurrency transactions, money launderers must continue evolving tactics to stay ahead of the curve.

Strategies to prevent or detect it:

- Monitoring network traffic: Monitoring network traffic for connections to known cryptocurrency exchanges and mixers can help to identify when a user is switching between different blockchain networks or cryptocurrencies.
- Identifying transaction patterns: Analyzing transaction patterns on different blockchain networks can help to identify when a user is hopping between different networks or currencies. This can include monitoring for changes in transaction volume or frequency, as well as identifying transactions that use similar addresses or follow similar patterns.
- Analysis of blockchain data: Analyzing blockchain data can help identify activity patterns indicative of chain hopping. This can include monitoring for large transfers of funds between different blockchain networks, as well as analyzing the addresses and transaction histories of known chain hoppers.
- Collaboration with law enforcement: Working with law enforcement agencies can help to identify and track down chain hoppers. This can include sharing intelligence on the latest chain-hopping techniques and collaborating on investigations.

Detecting chain hopping involves combining technical controls, analysis of blockchain data, and collaboration with law enforcement. By implementing these strategies, organizations can reduce the risk of fraud and other security incidents caused by chain hopping.
