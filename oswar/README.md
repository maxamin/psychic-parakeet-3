# 🔐 OSWAR (Open Standard Web3 Attack Reference) 

OSWAR is a comprehensive framework inspired by the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**, designed to identify, categorize, and mitigate `Web3`-related attacks and vulnerabilities. It provides a structured and actionable understanding of attacker behaviors, techniques, and vulnerabilities specific to decentralized systems such as blockchain platforms and decentralized applications (dApps).

## 🎯 Purpose

- The primary goal of OSWAR is to foster a **safer and more secure ecosystem** for the future of decentralization. 
- By offering detailed information and guidance on securing blockchain platforms, decentralized applications, and other Web3 technologies.
- OSWAR aims to **empower developers, auditors, and security researchers** with the knowledge they need to defend against potential threats.

## 🔥 Features

- **Comprehensive Attack Catalog**: OSWAR provides an extensive catalog of Web3-related attacks and vulnerabilities, organized into categories for easy navigation and reference.
- **Attack Techniques and Tactics**: Each attack in the catalog is accompanied by detailed information about the techniques and tactics employed by attackers, helping users gain a deeper understanding of potential threats.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: OSWAR offers actionable guidance and best practices to mitigate each identified attack, providing developers and security practitioners with effective countermeasures.
- **Community Collaboration**: OSWAR is an open standard framework, `encouraging collaboration and contributions from the Web3 community` to enhance the knowledge base and improve the overall security of decentralized systems.

## ✍️ Getting Started

- To explore various categories of attacks, visit **[oswar.org](https://www.oswar.org/)**
- Each category provides information about different types of attacks.
- Once you `select a category`, you can choose a specific vulnerability to read about.
- If you have a `new attack type` to contribute, you can click on **"Add Attack"** and make the necessary changes on the corresponding GitHub page. 
- This will allow you to submit your new attack for publication.
- If you find any **inaccuracies** or feel that changes are needed in the content of an existing vulnerability, you can click on the `"EDIT"` button at the bottom of the page. This will redirect you to the corresponding GitHub page where you can make the necessary modifications.
-  After making the changes, you can raise a **Pull Request on the GitHub** repository for review.

> Congratulations! You've successfully submitted your PR for review and publishing 🚀
