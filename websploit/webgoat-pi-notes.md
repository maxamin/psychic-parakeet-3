# WebGoat in Raspberry Pi 
Since Raspberry Pi uses the ARM architecture and my previous container was created for x86. It will not work in the Raspberry Pi. I tested all of the following instructions in Raspberry Pi 4.

The name of the new container is `webgoat-pi`.

WebGoat is a Java application and needs the following in order to run:

- Java 11
- Maven > 3.2.1
- Git
