30 Web Application Security Vulnerabilities in 30 Minutes
---

Terracotta Bank is vulnerable to many attack vectors.
Below is a sequence of attacks that can be levied against Terracotta Bank.
With some practice, you can perform all of these in order in 30 minutes.

1. Information Disclosure
The error page is not customized. Placing invalid information into the login page will show this login page, telling you important deployment information.

2. Authentication Bypass
The login request doesn't validate database results; as such, a carefully crafted username can bypass the authentication mechanism.

3. Blind SQL Injection
The login page is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection -- using a tool like sqlmap can reveal important database information

4. Username Enumeration
The usernames can be enumerated since the Forgot Password form gives a different error message when a known username is entered vs an unknown username.

5. Reflected Cross-site Scripting
Numerous inputs reflect the user's input back in their response and are vulnerable to cross-site scripting

6. Persistent Cross-site Scripting
Messages sent via the Contact Us Form are persisted and viewable by customer service reps

7. Default Admin Credentials
The customer service endpoint uses default admin credentials

8. Session Hijacking
The session cookie incorrectly leaves the httponly flag off, meaning that it can be retreived via Javascript

9. SpEL Injection + Remote Code Execution
The Show Accounts endpoint accepts SpEL and neither escapes nor sandboxes it.

10. Forced Browser
The robots.txt page reveals specific login endpoints

11. Session Fixation
The application accepts session ids in the URL and does not correctly invalidate that session id upon login. 
This will enable a malicious user to, for example, share his session id with an honest user and assume the logged in status of the honest user.

12. Broken Access Control
The application makes authorization decisions based on client-provided information. This can be used to gain access to the backoffice.

13. Log Injection
The backoffice contains request logs, a user can submit a carefully crafted request to introduce a log that appears legitimate

14. CSRF - GET
Numerous endpoints in Terracotta expose themselves as both GET and POST, meaning that a malicious user can forge GET requests that make material change to an honest user's account.

15. CSRF - POST
Numerous endpoints do not protect from a malicious user POSTing on the user's behalf.

16. Insecure Randomness
Many entity identifiers are not random, meaning that valid identifiers can be guessed or derived.

17. Input Tampering
When transferring money, the value of the select dropdown can be overridden.

18. Open Redirect
The application does not validate redirects and a malicious user can supply a specially crafted URL or form POST that will redirect an honest user to a configured location when the honest user logs in.

19. CRLF Injection
The application interprets specially crafted encoded characters to carriage returns and line feeds, allowing them into response headers.

20. Session Pinning
The application's vulnerability to Open Redirect and CRLF Injection can be combined into an attack where a malicious user can pin the user to a malicious user's session.

21. Directory Traversal
The application is vulnerable to directory traversal in the Deposit form.

22. Malicious File Upload
The application does not check the nature of files uploaded in the Deposit form.

23. Zip Slip
The application allows for zip files to be uploaded to the Deposit form and does not normalize the paths listed in the zip file.

24. Phishing
The application's vulnerability to Zip Slip or Malicious File Upload allows a malicious user to replace existing application views, enabling Phishing.

25. XXE - XInclude
The application uses an XML Parser with XInclude enabled, meaning a malicious user can craft an XML payload that reflects private resources in the response.

26. XXE - Exfiltration
The application parses DOCTYPE headers provided by a malicious user, enabling data exfiltration

27. XXE - Memory DoS
The application parses DOCTYPE headers provided by a malicious user, enabling a memory DoS. 

28. ReDoS
The application uses a poorly-formed regular expression that takes an exponentional amount of CPU to determine invalid strings.

29. Insecure Deserialization - JSON
The application allows a malicious user to indicate which class to deserialize a JSON payload into, enabling deserialization gadgets.

30. Insecure Deserialization - Java Serialization
The application allows a malicious user to specify Java serialized payloads, enabling deserialization gadgets.
