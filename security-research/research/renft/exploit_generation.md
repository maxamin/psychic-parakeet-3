## Exploit Generation

#### Focus
- Exploit on rental stoppage/termination/conclusion/asset reclaim.

#### Rental conclusion info
- A fully constructed 'RentalOrder' struct is needed to stop any rental order and reclaim assets.
- When a rental has expired, any address can initiate the asset reclaimation process to send the rented assets and payments back to the lender/intended recipients.
- Stopping a rental order involves passing in the EIP-712 hash of a previously initiated order rental struct.
- There exists two ways to stop orders.
- One: stop a single order at a time.
- Two: batch stop multiple orders in a single contract call.

#### Stoppage conditions
- A 'RentalOrder' struct must be created from emitted data during the rental creation process.
- With the struct obtained, a single order or multiple orders can be stopped using ```stopRent()``` or ```stopRentBatch()``` respectively.
- In order for a rental to be considered valid for stopping it must meet certain conditions.
- If an order is a 'BASE' order, then it can only be stopped at or after the rental has expired.
- Any address can stop a 'BASE' order.
- If the order is a 'PAY' order and the stopper is the lender of the order, then it does not matter whether or not the rental has expired.
- In ^ case, any payments will be pro-rata split between the lender and the renter, but if the stopper is not the lender, then the rental must have expired before it can be stopped.

#### Idea generation
- Break invariants such that lenders/intended recipients may not receive assets/payments or amounts are incorrect etc.

#### Intimate process analysis
- 

#### Points of consideration
- For loop in stopRent only iterates to less than the length of the items in the order? Not iterate to equal to >=?
