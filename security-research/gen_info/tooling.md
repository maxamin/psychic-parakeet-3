## Security Tooling

#### Overview
- Test suite - Foundry.
- Static analysis - slither - automatically checks code for issues without executing anything.
- Fuzzing/fuzz testing - involves providing random data as inputs during testing.
- Statful fuzzing testing - fuzzing but the system remembers the state of the last fuzz test and continues with a new fuzz test.
- Formal verification - applying formal methods to verify the correctness of a system. 
- Symbolic execution - a form of FV where the code is converted to math. 
- Thus far, only 20% of bugs are machine findable.
