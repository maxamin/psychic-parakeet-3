## ERC-721

#### What is an ERC-721
- An ERC-721 is an NFT.
- They are a token standard that was created on the Ethereum platform.
- ERC-721 is just another token standard, similar to ERC-20.
- Uniquely, ERC-721 are each individual in their value, they are not equal to one another.
- Each ERC-721 token, or NFT, are unique, and not directly interchangable for one another.
- ERC-721's are also just smart contracts that are deployable on different platforms.
- The main difference between ERC-20's and 721's is that 20's have a very simple mapping between an address and how much that address holds.
```
contract ERC20 is Context, IERC20 {
  mapping (address => uint256) private _balances;
}
```
- 721's have unique token id's.
```
// Mapping from token ID to owner address.
mapping (uint256 => address) private _owners;
```
- Additionally, 721's have a token URI.
- Each 721 token ID represents a unique asset.
- The token URI is an indicator which ascribes a tokens attributes.
- Simple API calls can be used to obtain a tokens URI.
- This metadata is often stored offchain and poses a centralization risk.
