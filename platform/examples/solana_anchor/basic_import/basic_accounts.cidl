  title: Validate Accounts
  summary: |-
    - The purpose of this CIDL is to validate all the supported features for an account
    - Verifies it can define a Non-PDA account with one field
    - Verifies it can define PDA account with one field and a static seed
    - Verifies it can define PDA account with one field, a static and dynamic seed
    - Verifies it can define PDA account with all the possible seeds data types
    - Verifies account space is calculated automatically
    - Verifies it can mark an account as mutable
    - Verifies it can mark an account as immutable
    - Verifies it can generate the code to initialize an account in "Singleton mode" a.k.a init
    - Verifies it can generate the code to initialize an account in "Non-Singleton mode" a.k.a init_if_needed
    - Verifies the fee payer is the default payer when using an initialization method without explicitly specifying the payer
    - Verifies it can close_unsafe a Non-PDA account
    - Verifies it can close a Non-PDA account
    - Verifies it can close a PDA account
    - Verifies the fee payer is the default lamport receiver when a rent receiver is not specify
