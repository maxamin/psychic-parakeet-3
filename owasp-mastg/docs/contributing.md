## üö´ What not to do

Although we greatly appreciate any and all contributions to the project, there are a few things that you should take into consideration:

- **No advertisement**: The OWASP mobile Security Project cannot be used as a platform for advertisement of commercial tools, companies or individuals. Technical content such as the implementation of certain techniques or tests should be written with free and open-source tools in mind. Commercial tools are typically not accepted, but might be referenced in some specific cases.
- **No unnecessary self-promotion of tools or blog posts**: If you have a relation with one of the URLs or tools you are referencing, please state so in the PR so that we can verify that the reference is in line with the rest of the guide.

Please be sure to take a careful look at our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mastg/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md "Code of Conduct") for all the details and [ask us](contact.md) in case of doubt.
