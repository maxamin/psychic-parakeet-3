## Building locally

To build a new version of the documentation, first install
the requirements with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
Then change directories (or `cd`) to the `docs/` directory
and run `make clean html`.
Any build warnings or errors will be displayed in your terminal,
and the new documentation will then be available in the `docs/build/html/` directory.
You may also find the
[Sphinx documentation style guide](https://documentation-style-guide-sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html)
useful when editing reStructuredText (reST) if you normally use Markdown.

## Guidelines

When possible, avoid links to websites that are affiliated with
specific security groups or companies.
